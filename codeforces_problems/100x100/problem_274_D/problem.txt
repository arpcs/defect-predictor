        "statement": "<p>Lenny had an <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>m</i></span> matrix of positive integers. He loved the matrix so much, because each row of the matrix was sorted in non-decreasing order. For the same reason he calls such matrices of integers <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">lovely</span>.</p><p>One day when Lenny was at school his little brother was playing with Lenny's matrix in his room. He erased some of the entries of the matrix and changed the order of some of its columns. When Lenny got back home he was very upset. Now Lenny wants to recover his matrix.</p><p>Help him to find an order for the columns of the matrix so that it's possible to fill in the erased entries of the matrix to achieve a lovely matrix again. Note, that you can fill the erased entries of the matrix with any integers.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains two positive integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>\u00b7<i>m</i>\u2009\u2264\u200910<sup class=\"upper-index\">5</sup></span>). Each of the next <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> lines contains <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> space-separated integers representing the matrix. An integer -1 shows an erased entry of the matrix. All other integers (each of them is between <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup></span> inclusive) represent filled entries.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>If there exists no possible reordering of the columns print -1. Otherwise the output should contain <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009<i>p</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009<i>p</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>m</i></sub></span> showing the sought permutation of columns. So, the first column of the lovely matrix will be <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub></span>-th column of the initial matrix, the second column of the lovely matrix will be <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub></span>-th column of the initial matrix and so on.</p>",
