You can try to guess it using the following queries:</p><p>$$$?$$$ $$$k$$$ $$$a_1$$$ $$$a_2$$$ $$$\\dots$$$ $$$a_k$$$.</p><p>In response, you will learn if the average of elements with indexes $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$ is an integer. In other words, you will receive $$$1$$$ if $$$\\frac{p_{a_1} + p_{a_2} + \\dots + p_{a_k}}{k}$$$ is integer, and $$$0$$$ otherwise. </p><p>You have to guess the permutation. You can ask <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not more than $$$18n$$$ queries</span>.</p><p>Note that permutations $$$[p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k]$$$ and $$$[n + 1 - p_1, n + 1 - p_2, \\dots, n + 1 - p_k]$$$ are indistinguishable. Therefore, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">you are guaranteed that $$$p_1 \\le \\frac{n}{2}$$$</span>.</p><p>Note that the permutation $$$p$$$ is fixed before the start of the interaction and doesn't depend on your queries. In other words, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">interactor is not adaptive</span>.</p><p>Note that you don't have to minimize the number of queries.</p>",
