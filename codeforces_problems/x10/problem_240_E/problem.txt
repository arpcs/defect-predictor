        "statement": "<p>A country named Berland has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> cities. They are numbered with integers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. City with index <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> is the capital of the country. Some pairs of cities have monodirectional roads built between them. However, not all of them are in good condition. For each road we know whether it needs repairing or not. If a road needs repairing, then it is forbidden to use it. However, the Berland government can repair the road so that it can be used.</p><p>Right now Berland is being threatened by the war with the neighbouring state. So the capital officials decided to send a military squad to each city. The squads can move only along the existing roads, as there's no time or money to build new roads. However, some roads will probably have to be repaired in order to get to some cities.</p><p>Of course the country needs much resources to defeat the enemy, so you want to be careful with what you're going to throw the forces on. That's why the Berland government wants to repair the minimum number of roads that is enough for the military troops to get to any city from the capital, driving along good or repaired roads. Your task is to help the Berland government and to find out, which roads need to be repaired.</p>",
