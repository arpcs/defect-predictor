        "title": "A. Parallel Projection",
        "statement": "<p>Vika's house has a room in a shape of a rectangular parallelepiped (also known as a rectangular cuboid). Its floor is a rectangle of size $$$w \\times d$$$, and the ceiling is right above at the constant height of $$$h$$$. Let's introduce a coordinate system on the floor so that its corners are at points $$$(0, 0)$$$, $$$(w, 0)$$$, $$$(w, d)$$$, and $$$(0, d)$$$.</p><p>A laptop is standing on the floor at point $$$(a, b)$$$. A projector is hanging on the ceiling right above point $$$(f, g)$$$. Vika wants to connect the laptop and the projector with a cable in such a way that the cable always goes along the walls, ceiling, or floor (i.\u00a0e. does not go inside the cuboid). Additionally, the cable should always run <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">parallel</span> to one of the cuboid's edges (i.\u00a0e. it can not go diagonally).</p><p>What is the minimum length of a cable that can connect the laptop to the projector?</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ed0adbc8cdc3817c1b06788ae48af57df2751a86.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"378px\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">Illustration for the first test case. One of the optimal ways to put the cable is shown in green.</span> </center>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$d$$$, and $$$h$$$ ($$$2 \\le w, d, h \\le 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the room.</p><p>The second line contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$f$$$, $$$g$$$ ($$$0 &lt; a, f &lt; w$$$; $$$0 &lt; b, g &lt; d$$$): the laptop is located on the floor at point $$$(a, b)$$$, while the projector is hanging on the ceiling right above point $$$(f, g)$$$.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum length of the cable connecting the laptop and the projector that runs only along the walls, floor, and ceiling parallel to cuboid's edges.</p>",
