The boxes have a wonderful feature: if you put <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>x</i>\u2009\u2265\u20090)</span> divisors (the spacial bars that can divide a box) to it, you get a box, divided into <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009+\u20091</span> sections.</p><p>You are minimalist. Therefore, on the one hand, you are against dividing some box into more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> sections. On the other hand, you are against putting more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i></span> nuts into some section of the box. What is the minimum number of boxes you have to use if you want to put all the nuts in boxes, and you have <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> divisors?</p><p>Please note that you need to minimize the number of used boxes, not sections. You do not have to minimize the number of used divisors.</p>",

Overall, the first box will have nine nuts. </li><li> Do not put any divisors into the second box. Thus, the second box has one section for the last nut. </li></ul><p>In the end we've put all the ten nuts into boxes.</p><p>The second sample is different as we have exactly one divisor and we put it to the first box. The next two boxes will have one section each.</p>"
