The value of the $$$i$$$-th element of the array is $$$a_i$$$.</p><p>You are also given a set of $$$m$$$ segments. The $$$j$$$-th segment is $$$[l_j; r_j]$$$, where $$$1 \\le l_j \\le r_j \\le n$$$.</p><p>You can choose some subset of the given set of segments and decrease values on each of the chosen segments by one (<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">independently</span>). For example, if the initial array $$$a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ and the given segments are $$$[1; 3]$$$ and $$$[2; 4]$$$ then you can choose both of them and the array will become $$$b = [-1, -2, -2, -1, 0]$$$.</p><p>You have to choose some subset of the given segments (<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">each segment can be chosen at most once</span>) in such a way that if you apply this subset of segments to the array $$$a$$$ and obtain the array $$$b$$$ then the value $$$\\max\\limits_{i=1}^{n}b_i - \\min\\limits_{i=1}^{n}b_i$$$ will be <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximum</span> possible.</p><p>Note that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">you can choose the empty set</span>.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, you can print <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span>.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.</span></p>",
