To describe the process of making a Cartridge more clearly, she abstracts the original problem and gives you the following problem.</p><p>You are given a tree $$$T$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Each vertex has values $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ and each edge has values $$$c_j$$$ and $$$d_j$$$.</p><p>Now you are aim to build a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">tree</span> $$$T'$$$ as follows:</p><ul> <li> First, select $$$p$$$ vertices from $$$T$$$ ($$$p$$$ is a number chosen by yourself) as the vertex set $$$S'$$$ of $$$T'$$$. </li><li> Next, select $$$p-1$$$ edges from $$$T$$$ one by one (you cannot select one edge more than once). </li><li> May you have chosen the $$$j$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$x_j$$$ and $$$y_j$$$ with values $$$(c_j,d_j)$$$, then you can choose two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in $$$S'$$$ that satisfy the edge $$$(x_j,y_j)$$$ is contained in the simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ in $$$T$$$, and link $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in $$$T'$$$ by the edge with values $$$(c_j,d_j)$$$ ($$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ shouldn't be contained in one connected component before in $$$T'$$$). </li></ul><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/83bd6bc3068f972298814721f1a9283af5d75485.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">A tree with three vertices, $$$\\min(A,C)=1,B+D=7$$$, the cost is $$$7$$$.</span> </center><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/c3711ea7ef37bb91897e7a1dc3958e4c6c3182d2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">Selected vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ as $$$S'$$$, used the edge $$$(1,2)$$$ with $$$c_j = 2$$$ and $$$d_j = 1$$$ to link this vertices, now $$$\\min(A,C)=2,B+D=4$$$, the cost is $$$8$$$.</span> </center><p>Let $$$A$$$ be the minimum of values $$$a_i$$$ in $$$T'$$$ and $$$C$$$ be the minimum of values $$$c_i$$$ in $$$T'$$$. Let $$$B$$$ be the sum of $$$b_i$$$ in $$$T'$$$ and $$$D$$$ be the sum of values $$$d_i$$$ in $$$T'$$$. Let $$$\\min(A, C) \\cdot (B + D)$$$ be the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">cost</span> of $$$T'$$$. You need to find the maximum possible cost of $$$T'$$$.</p>",
