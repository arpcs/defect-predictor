Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$8$$$, $$$9$$$, ....</p><p>For a given number $$$n$$$, count the number of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such $$$x$$$ that $$$x$$$ is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).</p>",
