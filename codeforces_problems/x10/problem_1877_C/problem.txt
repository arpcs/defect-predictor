        "statement": "<p>Chaneka, a gamer kid, invented a new gaming controller called joyboard. Interestingly, the joyboard she invented can only be used to play one game.</p><p>The joyboard has a screen containing $$$n+1$$$ slots numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n+1$$$ from left to right. The $$$n+1$$$ slots are going to be filled with an array of non-negative integers $$$[a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots,a_{n+1}]$$$. Chaneka, as the player, must assign $$$a_{n+1}$$$ with an integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$m$$$ inclusive. Then, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$n$$$ to $$$1$$$, the value of $$$a_i$$$ will be equal to the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">remainder</span> of dividing $$$a_{i+1}$$$ (the adjacent value to the right) by $$$i$$$. In other words, $$$a_i = a_{i + 1} \\bmod i$$$.</p><p>Chaneka wants it such that after every slot is assigned with an integer, there are exactly $$$k$$$ distinct values in the entire screen (among all $$$n+1$$$ slots). How many valid ways are there for assigning a non-negative integer into slot $$$n+1$$$?</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2\\cdot10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$; $$$0 \\leq m \\leq 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n+1$$$) \u2014 there are $$$n+1$$$ slots, the integer assigned in slot $$$n+1$$$ must not be bigger than $$$m$$$, and there should be exactly $$$k$$$ distinct values.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, output a line containing an integer representing the number of valid ways for assigning a non-negative integer into slot $$$n+1$$$.</p>",

If she does that, then $$$a = [0, 0, 0]$$$. There is only $$$1$$$ distinct value.</p><p>In the third test case, there is no possible way for assigning a non-negative integer into slot $$$n+1$$$.</p>"
