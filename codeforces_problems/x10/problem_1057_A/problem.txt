        "statement": "<p>Once upon a time there was only one router in the well-known company Bmail. Years went by and over time new routers were purchased. Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You are given the values $$$p_i$$$ \u2014 the index of the router to which the $$$i$$$-th router was connected after being purchased ($$$p_i &lt; i$$$).</p><p>There are $$$n$$$ routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the $$$n$$$-th router.</p>",

The following line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i &lt; i$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is equal to index of the router to which the $$$i$$$-th was connected after purchase.</p>",
