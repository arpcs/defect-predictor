In particular, $$$r_i=0$$$ if the leftmost cell of the $$$i$$$-th row is empty. </li><li> $$$c_{j}$$$ is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the top end in the $$$j$$$-th column ($$$1 \\le j \\le w$$$). In particular, $$$c_j=0$$$ if the topmost cell of the $$$j$$$-th column is empty. </li></ul><p>In other words, the $$$i$$$-th row starts exactly with $$$r_i$$$ full cells.

Black cells are full and white cells are empty.</span> </center><p>You have values of $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$. Initially, all cells are empty. Find the number of ways to fill grid cells to satisfy values of $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo $$$1000000007\\,(10^{9} + 7)$$$. In other words, find the remainder after division of the answer by $$$1000000007\\,(10^{9} + 7)$$$.</p>",
