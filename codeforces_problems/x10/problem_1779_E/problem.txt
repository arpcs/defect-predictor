In each game, she chooses two players. One of them wins and stays, while the other one is disqualified. After all the games are hosted only one player will remain. A player is said to be a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">candidate master</span> if they can win a tournament (notice that the winner of a tournament may depend on the players selected by Anya in the $$$n-1$$$ games).</p><p>Since Anya is a curious girl, she is interested in finding the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">candidate masters</span>. Unfortunately, she does not have much time. To speed up the process, she will organize up to $$$2n$$$ simuls (short for \"simultaneous exhibition\", in which one player plays against many).</p><p>In one simul, Anya chooses <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one</span> player who will play against some (at least one) of the other players. The chosen player wins all games they would win in a regular game, and the same holds for losses. After the simul finishes, Anya is only told the total number of games won by the chosen player (but not which ones). Nobody is disqualified during a simul.</p><p>Can you help Anya host simuls and determine the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">candidate masters</span>?</p><p>The winning players in each pair <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">could be</span> changed between the simuls, but only in a way that preserves the results of all previous simuls. These changes may depend on your queries.</p>",

Similarly, the second query tells us that $$$2$$$ beats $$$3$$$ and the third query tells us that $$$3$$$ beats $$$1$$$.

The answer to the query is $$$4$$$, meaning that they won every game they played. It can be concluded that player $$$1$$$ also beats every other player. They can never lose, hence they are the only player who can remain at the end of every possible tournament, and the only possible <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">candidate master</span>. </p>"
