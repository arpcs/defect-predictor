        "statement": "<p>Yura owns a quite ordinary and boring array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You think there is nothing more boring than that, but Vladik doesn't agree!</p><p>In order to make Yura's array even more boring, Vladik makes $$$q$$$ boring queries. Each query consists of two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Before answering a query, the bounds $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ for this query are calculated: $$$l = (last + x) \\bmod n + 1$$$, $$$r = (last + y) \\bmod n + 1$$$, where $$$last$$$ is the answer on the previous query (zero initially), and $$$\\bmod$$$ is the remainder operation. Whenever $$$l &gt; r$$$, they are swapped.</p><p>After Vladik computes $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ for a query, he is to compute the least common multiple (LCM) on the segment $$$[l; r]$$$ of the initial array $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. LCM of a multiset of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the elements of the multiset. The obtained LCM is the answer for this query.</p><p>Help Vladik and compute the answer for each query!</p>",
