Insert $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ to $$$A$$$, delete $$$x$$$ from $$$A$$$. </li></ul><p>Note that the size of the multiset $$$A$$$ increases by $$$1$$$ after each operation. </p><p>We define the balance of the multiset $$$A$$$ as $$$\\max(a_i) - \\min(a_i)$$$.

After this our multiset will be $$$\\{3,4,2,3\\}$$$.
