Let's introduce a coordinate system with the origin at the lower left corner (see the picture). </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/32d52d7438a96f3efd1d66b51d4181d84fc7ecd2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>There is one ball at the point $$$(x, y)$$$ currently. Max comes to the table and strikes the ball. The ball starts moving along a line that is parallel to one of the axes or that makes a $$$45^{\\circ}$$$ angle with them. We will assume that: </p><ol> <li> the angles between the directions of the ball before and after a collision with a side are equal, </li><li> the ball moves indefinitely long, it only stops when it falls into a pocket, </li><li> the ball can be considered as a point, it falls into a pocket if and only if its coordinates coincide with one of the pockets, </li><li> initially the ball is not in a pocket. </li></ol><p>Note that the ball can move along some side, in this case the ball will just fall into the pocket at the end of the side.</p><p>Your task is to determine whether the ball will fall into a pocket eventually, and if yes, which of the four pockets it will be.</p>",
