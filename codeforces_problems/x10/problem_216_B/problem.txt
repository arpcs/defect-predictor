They want to play football, and for that they need to split into teams, the teams must have an equal number of people.</p><p>We know that this group of people has archenemies. Each student has at most two archenemies. Besides, if student <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> is an archenemy to student <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span>, then student <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> is an archenemy to student <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span>.</p><p>The students want to split so as no two archenemies were in one team. If splitting in the required manner is impossible, some students will have to sit on the bench.</p><p>Determine the minimum number of students you will have to send to the bench in order to form the two teams in the described manner and begin the game at last.</p>",
