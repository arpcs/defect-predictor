        "statement": "<p>You are given a connected weighted undirected graph, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.</p><p>You are asked $$$k$$$ queries about it. Each query consists of a single integer $$$x$$$. For each query, you select a spanning tree in the graph. Let the weights of its edges be $$$w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{n-1}$$$. The cost of a spanning tree is $$$\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} |w_i - x|$$$ (the sum of absolute differences between the weights and $$$x$$$). The answer to a query is the lowest cost of a spanning tree.</p><p>The queries are given in a compressed format. The first $$$p$$$ $$$(1 \\le p \\le k)$$$ queries $$$q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_p$$$ are provided explicitly. For queries from $$$p+1$$$ to $$$k$$$, $$$q_j = (q_{j-1} \\cdot a + b) \\mod c$$$.</p><p>Print the xor of answers to all queries.</p>",
