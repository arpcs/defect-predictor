        "statement": "<p>You are given a long decimal number $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$. You also have a function $$$f$$$ that maps every digit from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ to some (possibly the same) digit from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.</p><p>You can perform the following operation <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">no more than once</span>: choose a non-empty <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">contiguous subsegment</span> of digits in $$$a$$$, and replace each digit $$$x$$$ from this segment with $$$f(x)$$$. For example, if $$$a = 1337$$$, $$$f(1) = 1$$$, $$$f(3) = 5$$$, $$$f(7) = 3$$$, and you choose the segment consisting of three rightmost digits, you get $$$1553$$$ as the result.</p><p>What is the maximum possible number you can obtain applying this operation no more than once?</p>",

Each character is a decimal digit from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.</p><p>The third line contains exactly $$$9$$$ integers $$$f(1)$$$, $$$f(2)$$$, ..., $$$f(9)$$$ ($$$1 \\le f(i) \\le 9$$$).</p>",
