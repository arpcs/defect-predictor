Note that for any positive integer $$$x$$$, $$$\\gcd(\\{x\\})=\\textrm{lcm}(\\{x\\})=x$$$.</p><p>Orac has a sequence $$$a$$$ with length $$$n$$$. He come up with the multiset $$$t=\\{\\textrm{lcm}(\\{a_i,a_j\\})\\ |\\ i&lt;j\\}$$$, and asked you to find the value of $$$\\gcd(t)$$$ for him. In other words, you need to calculate the GCD of LCMs of all pairs of elements in the given sequence.</p>",
