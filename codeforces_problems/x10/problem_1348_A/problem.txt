No matter how he divides the coins, the difference will be $$$4-2=2$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, Phoenix has four coins of weight $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$8$$$, and $$$16$$$. It is optimal for Phoenix to place coins with weights $$$2$$$ and $$$16$$$ in one pile, and coins with weights $$$4$$$ and $$$8$$$ in another pile. The difference is $$$(2+16)-(4+8)=6$$$.</p>"
