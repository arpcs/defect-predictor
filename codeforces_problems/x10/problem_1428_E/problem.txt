        "statement": "<p>There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought $$$n$$$ carrots with lengths $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n$$$. However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has $$$k$$$ rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into $$$k$$$ pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.</p><p>Big carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size $$$x$$$ is $$$x^2$$$.</p><p>Help Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq k \\leq 10^5)$$$: the initial number of carrots and the number of rabbits.</p><p>The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^6)$$$: lengths of carrots.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$a_i$$$ is at least $$$k$$$.</p>",
