The Stock Exchange Reykjavik is the only actual stock exchange in the world. The only type of transaction is to take a single share of stock $$$x$$$ and exchange it for a single share of stock $$$y$$$, provided that the current price of share $$$x$$$ is at least the current price of share $$$y$$$. </p><p>There are $$$2n$$$ stocks listed on the SER that are of interest to Bob, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$. Bob owns a single share of stocks $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$ and would like to own a single share of each of $$$n+1$$$ through $$$2n$$$ some time in the future.</p><p>Bob managed to forecast the price of each stock\u00a0\u2014 in time $$$t \\geq 0$$$, the stock $$$i$$$ will cost $$$a_i \\cdot \\lfloor t \\rfloor + b_i$$$. The time is currently $$$t = 0$$$. Help Bob find the earliest moment in time in which he can own a single share of each of $$$n+1$$$ through $$$2n$$$, and the minimum number of stock exchanges he has to perform in order to do that.</p><p>You may assume that the Stock Exchange has an unlimited amount of each stock at any point in time. </p>",

Note that he can achieve his goal also with only two exchanges, but this would take total time of $$$t = 9$$$, when he would finally be able to exchange the share number $$$2$$$ for the share number $$$3$$$. </p><p>In the third example, Bob can never achieve his goal, as the second stock is always strictly more expensive than the first one.</p>"
