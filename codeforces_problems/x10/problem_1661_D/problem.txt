The chosen subsegment should be inside the borders of the array $$$a$$$ (i.e., if the left border of the chosen subsegment is $$$l$$$, then the condition $$$1 \\le l \\le l + k - 1 \\le n$$$ should be satisfied). Note that the progression added is always $$$1, 2, \\ldots, k$$$ but not the $$$k, k - 1, \\ldots, 1$$$ or anything else (i.e., the leftmost element of the subsegment always increases by $$$1$$$, the second element always increases by $$$2$$$ and so on).</p><p>Your task is to find the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition $$$a_i \\ge b_i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.
