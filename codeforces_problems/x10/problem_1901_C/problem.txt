In one operation, you can choose an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\le x \\le 10^{18}$$$) and replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a_i + x}{2} \\rfloor$$$ ($$$\\lfloor y \\rfloor$$$ denotes rounding $$$y$$$ down to the nearest integer) for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Pay attention to the fact that all elements of the array are affected on each operation. </p><p>Print the smallest number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal.</p><p>If the number of operations is less than or equal to $$$n$$$, then print the chosen $$$x$$$ for each operation.

        "note": "<p>In the first testcase, all elements are already equal, so $$$0$$$ operations are required. It doesn't matter if you print an empty line afterwards or not.</p><p>In the second testcase, you can't make less than $$$2$$$ operations. There are multiple answers, let's consider the answer sequence $$$[2, 5]$$$. After applying an operation with $$$x = 2$$$, the array becomes $$$[\\lfloor \\frac{4 + 2}{2} \\rfloor, \\lfloor \\frac{6 + 2}{2} \\rfloor] = [3, 4]$$$. After applying an operation with $$$x = 5$$$ after that, the array becomes $$$[\\lfloor \\frac{3 + 5}{2} \\rfloor, \\lfloor \\frac{4 + 5}{2} \\rfloor] = [4, 4]$$$. Both elements are the same, so we are done.</p><p>In the last testcase, you can't make less than $$$6$$$ operations. Since $$$6$$$ is greater than $$$n$$$, you don't have to print them. One possible answer sequence is $$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$. We are just dividing the second element by $$$2$$$ every time and not changing the first element.</p>"
