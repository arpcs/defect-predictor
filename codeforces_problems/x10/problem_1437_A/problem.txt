        "statement": "<p>You got a job as a marketer in a pet shop, and your current task is to boost sales of cat food. One of the strategies is to sell cans of food in packs with discounts. </p><p>Suppose you decided to sell packs with $$$a$$$ cans in a pack with a discount and some customer wants to buy $$$x$$$ cans of cat food. Then he follows a greedy strategy: </p><ul> <li> he buys $$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor$$$ packs with a discount; </li><li> then he wants to buy the remaining $$$(x \\bmod a)$$$ cans one by one. </li></ul><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">$$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor$$$ is $$$x$$$ divided by $$$a$$$ rounded down, $$$x \\bmod a$$$ is the remainer of $$$x$$$ divided by $$$a$$$.</span></p><p>But customers are greedy in general, so if the customer wants to buy $$$(x \\bmod a)$$$ cans one by one and it happens that $$$(x \\bmod a) \\ge \\frac{a}{2}$$$ he decides to buy the whole pack of $$$a$$$ cans (instead of buying $$$(x \\bmod a)$$$ cans). It makes you, as a marketer, happy since the customer bought more than he wanted initially.</p><p>You know that each of the customers that come to your shop can buy any number of cans from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive. Can you choose such size of pack $$$a$$$ that each customer buys more cans than they wanted initially?</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the range of the number of cans customers can buy.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span> if you can choose such size of pack $$$a$$$ that each customer buys more cans than they wanted initially. Otherwise, print <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>.</p><p>You can print each character in any case.</p>",

            }
        ],
        "note": "<p>In the first test case, you can take, for example, $$$a = 5$$$ as the size of the pack. Then if a customer wants to buy $$$3$$$ cans, he'll buy $$$5$$$ instead ($$$3 \\bmod 5 = 3$$$, $$$\\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$$$). The one who wants $$$4$$$ cans will also buy $$$5$$$ cans.</p><p>In the second test case, there is no way to choose $$$a$$$.</p><p>In the third test case, you can take, for example, $$$a = 80$$$.</p>"
