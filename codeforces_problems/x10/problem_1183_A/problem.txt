        "statement": "<p>Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by $$$3$$$, then the number itself is divisible by $$$3$$$. He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by $$$4$$$, are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer $$$n$$$ interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by $$$4$$$.</p><p>Help Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $$$a$$$. That is, find the interesting number $$$n$$$ such that $$$n \\ge a$$$ and $$$n$$$ is minimal.</p>",
