Burenka knows that Eugene really likes <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">coprime</span> integers (integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that they have only one common factor (equal to $$$1$$$)) so she wants to to ask Eugene $$$q$$$ questions about the present. </p><p>Each time Burenka will choose a subsegment $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ of array $$$a$$$, and compute the product of these numbers $$$p = a_l \\cdot a_{l + 1} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a_r$$$. Then she will ask Eugene to count the number of integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$C$$$ inclusive which are coprime with $$$p$$$. </p><p>Help Eugene answer all the questions!</p>",
