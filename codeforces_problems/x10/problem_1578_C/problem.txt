        "statement": "<p>Cactus lady loves her cactuses very much. Especially she likes a small cactus named Cing. Cing can be seen as a connected undirected graph in which every vertex lies on at most one simple cycle. Intuitively, a cactus is a generalization of a tree where some cycles are allowed. Multiedges (multiple edges between a pair of vertices) and loops (edges that connect a vertex to itself) are not allowed.</p><p>She bought a special grid for her special little cactus Cing. This grid can be represented as a graph consisting of two paths of length $$$400\\,000$$$, $$$u_{(0, -200\\,000)} - u_{(0, -199\\,999)} - \\ldots - u_{(0, 200\\,000)}$$$ and $$$u_{(1, -200\\,000)} - u_{(1, -199\\,999)} - \\ldots - u_{(1, 200\\,000)}$$$, connected together by $$$400\\,001$$$ edges $$$(u_{(0, i)}, u_{(1, i)})$$$ for each $$$i$$$. In other words, a grid can be seen as a ladder.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/46b06f4eb93aa7dd8c832ea06a3e83b281939a76.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"265px\"/> </center><p>Cactus lady wants to know whether she can embed Cing into this grid, i.e., map each vertex of the cactus onto a separate vertex of the grid while each edge of the cactus will be mapped onto some edge of the grid.</p>",
