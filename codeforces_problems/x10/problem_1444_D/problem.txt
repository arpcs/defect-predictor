        "statement": "<p>One drew a closed polyline on a plane, that consisted only of vertical and horizontal segments (parallel to the coordinate axes). The segments alternated between horizontal and vertical ones (a horizontal segment was always followed by a vertical one, and vice versa). The polyline did not contain strict self-intersections, which means that in case any two segments shared a common point, that point was an endpoint for both of them (please consult the examples in the notes section).</p><p>Unfortunately, the polyline was erased, and you only know the lengths of the horizonal and vertical segments. Please construct any polyline matching the description with such segments, or determine that it does not exist.</p>",
