        "statement": "<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">This is the hard version of the problem. You can find the easy version in the Div. 2 contest. Both versions only differ in the number of times you can ask your friend to taste coffee.</span></p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">This is an interactive problem.</span></p><p>You're considering moving to another city, where one of your friends already lives. There are $$$n$$$ caf\u00e9s in this city, where $$$n$$$ is a power of two. The $$$i$$$-th caf\u00e9 produces a single variety of coffee $$$a_i$$$. </p><p>As you're a coffee-lover, before deciding to move or not, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">you want to know the number $$$d$$$ of distinct varieties of coffees</span> produced in this city.</p><p>You don't know the values $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Fortunately, your friend has a memory of size $$$k$$$, where $$$k$$$ is a power of two.</p><p>Once per day, you can ask him to taste a cup of coffee produced by the caf\u00e9 $$$c$$$, and he will tell you if he tasted a similar coffee during the last $$$k$$$ days.</p><p>You can also ask him to take a medication that will reset his memory. He will forget all previous cups of coffee tasted. You can reset his memory at most $$$30\\ 000$$$ times.</p><p>More formally, the memory of your friend is a queue $$$S$$$. Doing a query on caf\u00e9 $$$c$$$ will: </p><ul> <li> Tell you if $$$a_c$$$ is in $$$S$$$; </li><li> Add $$$a_c$$$ at the back of $$$S$$$; </li><li> If $$$|S| &gt; k$$$, pop the front element of $$$S$$$. </li></ul><p>Doing a reset request will pop all elements out of $$$S$$$.</p><p>Your friend can taste at most $$$\\dfrac{3n^2}{2k}$$$ cups of coffee in total. Find the diversity $$$d$$$ (number of distinct values in the array $$$a$$$).</p><p>Note that asking your friend to reset his memory <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">does not count</span> towards the number of times you ask your friend to taste a cup of coffee.</p><p>In some test cases the behavior of the interactor <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">is adaptive</span>. It means that the array $$$a$$$ may be <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not fixed</span> before the start of the interaction and may <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">depend on your queries</span>. It is guaranteed that at any moment of the interaction, there is at least one array $$$a$$$ consistent with all the answers given so far.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 1024$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ are powers of two).</p><p>It is guaranteed that $$$\\dfrac{3n^2}{2k} \\le 15\\ 000$$$.</p>",

The city produces $$$3$$$ different varieties of coffee ($$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$).</p><p>The successive varieties of coffee tasted by your friend are $$$1, 4, \\textbf{1}, 3, 3, 1, 4$$$ (bold answers correspond to <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Y</span> answers). Note that between the two <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">? 4</span> asks, there is a reset memory request <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>, so the answer to the second <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">? 4</span> ask is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">N</span>. Had there been no reset memory request, the answer to the second <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">? 4</span> ask is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Y</span>.</p><p>In the second example, the array is $$$a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6]$$$. The city produces $$$6$$$ different varieties of coffee.</p><p>The successive varieties of coffee tasted by your friend are $$$2, 6, 4, 5, \\textbf{2}, \\textbf{5}$$$.</p>"
