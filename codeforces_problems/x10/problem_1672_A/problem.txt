        "statement": "<p>There are $$$n$$$ logs, the $$$i$$$-th log has a length of $$$a_i$$$ meters. Since chopping logs is tiring work, errorgorn and maomao90 have decided to play a game.</p><p>errorgorn and maomao90 will take turns chopping the logs with <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">errorgorn chopping first</span>. On his turn, the player will pick a log and chop it into $$$2$$$ pieces. If the length of the chosen log is $$$x$$$, and the lengths of the resulting pieces are $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$, then $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$ have to be <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">positive integers</span>, and $$$x=y+z$$$ must hold. For example, you can chop a log of length $$$3$$$ into logs of lengths $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$, but not into logs of lengths $$$3$$$ and $$$0$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$, or $$$1.5$$$ and $$$1.5$$$.</p><p>The player who is unable to make a chop will be the loser. Assuming that both errorgorn and maomao90 play optimally, who will be the winner?</p>",

After this there will only be $$$4$$$ logs of length $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$ log of length $$$1$$$.</p><p>After this, the only move any player can do is to chop any log of length $$$2$$$ into $$$2$$$ logs of length $$$1$$$. After $$$4$$$ moves, it will be maomao90's turn and he will not be able to make a move. Therefore errorgorn will be the winner.</p><p>In the second test case, errorgorn will not be able to make a move on his first turn and will immediately lose, making maomao90 the winner.</p>"
