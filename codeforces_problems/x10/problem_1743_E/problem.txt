When Monocarp shoots an enemy spaceship, it receives $$$(P - s)$$$ damage (i.\u2009e. $$$(P - s)$$$ gets subtracted from its durability), where $$$P$$$ is the total power of the lasers that Monocarp shoots (i.\u2009e. $$$p_i$$$ if he only shoots laser $$$i$$$ and $$$p_1 + p_2$$$ if he shoots both lasers at the same time). An enemy spaceship is considered destroyed when its durability becomes $$$0$$$ or lower.</p><p>Initially, both lasers are zero charged.</p><p>What's the lowest amount of time it can take Monocarp to destroy an enemy spaceship?</p>",
