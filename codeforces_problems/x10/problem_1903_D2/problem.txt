The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$, the memory and time limits. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.</span></p><p>Theofanis really likes to play with the bits of numbers. He has an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. He can make at most $$$k$$$ operations in the array. In each operation, he picks a single element and increases it by $$$1$$$.</p><p>He found the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximum</span> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND\">bitwise AND</a> that array $$$a$$$ can have after at most $$$k$$$ operations.</p><p>Theofanis has put a lot of work into finding this value and was very happy with his result. Unfortunately, Ada\u015b, being the evil person that he is, decided to bully him by repeatedly changing the value of $$$k$$$.</p><p>Help Theofanis by calculating the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximum</span> possible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND\">bitwise AND</a> for $$$q$$$ different values of $$$k$$$.
