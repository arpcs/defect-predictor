        "statement": "<p>Demodogs from the Upside-down have attacked Hawkins again. El wants to reach Mike and also kill as many Demodogs in the way as possible.</p><p>Hawkins can be represented as an $$$n \\times n$$$ grid. The number of Demodogs in a cell at the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$i \\cdot j$$$. El is at position $$$(1, 1)$$$ of the grid, and she has to reach $$$(n, n)$$$ where she can find Mike. </p><p>The only directions she can move are the right (from $$$(i, j)$$$ to $$$(i, j + 1)$$$) and the down (from $$$(i, j)$$$ to $$$(i + 1, j)$$$). She can't go out of the grid, as there are doors to the Upside-down at the boundaries. </p><p>Calculate the maximum possible number of Demodogs $$$\\mathrm{ans}$$$ she can kill on the way, considering that she kills all Demodogs in cells she visits (including starting and finishing cells).</p><p>Print $$$2022 \\cdot \\mathrm{ans}$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. Modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$ because the result can be too large and multiplied by $$$2022$$$ because we are never gonna see it again!</p><p>(Note, you firstly multiply by $$$2022$$$ and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">only after</span> that take the remainder.)</p>",
