Your task is to find the number of connected components which are cycles.</p><p>Here are some definitions of graph theory.</p><p>An undirected graph consists of two sets: set of nodes (called vertices) and set of edges. Each edge connects a pair of vertices. All edges are bidirectional (i.e. if a vertex $$$a$$$ is connected with a vertex $$$b$$$, a vertex $$$b$$$ is also connected with a vertex $$$a$$$). An edge can't connect vertex with itself, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices.</p><p>Two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.</p><p>A connected component is a cycle if and only if its vertices can be reordered in such a way that:</p><ul> <li> the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge, </li><li> the second vertex is connected with the third vertex by an edge, </li><li> ... </li><li> the last vertex is connected with the first vertex by an edge, </li><li> all the described edges of a cycle are distinct. </li></ul><p>A cycle doesn't contain any other edges except described above.
