        "statement": "<p>A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array $$$p=[p_1,p_2,\\dots, p_n]$$$ which contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (inclusive) exactly once. For example, $$$p=[4, 2, 6, 5, 3, 1]$$$ is a permutation of length $$$6$$$.</p><p>You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, where $$$n$$$ is an even number. Print any permutation of length $$$n$$$ that the minimum among <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all its elements of the left half</span> equals $$$a$$$ and the maximum among <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all its elements of the right half</span> equals $$$b$$$.

The following $$$t$$$ lines contain test case descriptions.</p><p>Each test case description contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\le a,b \\le n$$$; $$$a \\ne b$$$), where $$$n$$$ is an even number (i.e. $$$n \\bmod 2 = 0$$$).</p>",
