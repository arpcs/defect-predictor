The $$$i$$$-th pile contains $$$a_i$$$ units of food. </p><p>Luke will walk from the $$$1$$$-st pile towards the $$$n$$$-th pile, and he wants to eat every pile of food without walking back. When Luke reaches the $$$i$$$-th pile, he can eat that pile if and only if $$$|v - a_i| \\leq x$$$, where $$$x$$$ is a fixed integer, and $$$v$$$ is Luke's food affinity.</p><p>Before Luke starts to walk, he can set $$$v$$$ to any integer. Also, for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), Luke can <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">change</span> his food affinity to any integer <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">before</span> he eats the $$$i$$$-th pile.</p><p>Find the minimum number of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">changes</span> needed to eat every pile of food.</p><p>Note that the initial choice for $$$v$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> considered as a change.</p>",
