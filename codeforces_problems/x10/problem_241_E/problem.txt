The country is well known because it has a very strange transportation system. There are many one-way flights that make it possible to travel between the cities, but the flights are arranged in a way that once you leave a city you will never be able to return to that city again.</p><p>Previously each flight took exactly one hour, but recently Lily has become the new manager of transportation system and she wants to change the duration of some flights. Specifically, she wants to change the duration of some flights to exactly 2 hours in such a way that all trips from city 1 to city <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> take the same time regardless of their path.</p><p>Your task is to help Lily to change the duration of flights.</p>",
