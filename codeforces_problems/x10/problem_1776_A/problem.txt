Walking Boy requires $$$120$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">consecutive</span> minutes. Two walks cannot overlap, but one can start as soon as the previous one has finished.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/e58c4454baa43646078f2f14e89d150f5959dc84.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"340px\"/><p>Boy before and after getting ACCEPTED on this problem. </p></center><p>Today, the judge sent $$$n$$$ messages to the SWERC Discord server. The $$$i$$$-th message was sent $$$a_i$$$ minutes after midnight. You know that, when walking Boy, the judge does not send any messages, but he can send a message right before or right after a walk. Is it possible that the judge walked Boy at least twice today?</p><p>Note that a day has $$$1440$$$ minutes, and a walk is considered to happen <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">today</span> if it starts at a minute $$$s \\ge 0$$$ and ends right before a minute $$$e \\le 1440$$$.
