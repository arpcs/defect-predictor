        "note": "<p>In the first test, if Vasya had $$$3$$$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $$$0$$$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $$$0$$$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $$$3$$$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).</p><p>In the second test, if Vasya had $$$0$$$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $$$4$$$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $$$4$$$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $$$4$$$ stones. So, the answer is $$$4$$$.</p><p>In the third test, if Vasya had $$$1$$$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $$$1$$$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.</p><p>In the fourth test, if Vasya had $$$0$$$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $$$3$$$.</p>"
