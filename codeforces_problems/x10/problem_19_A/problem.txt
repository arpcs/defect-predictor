BFA took the decision to change some World Cup regulations:</p><ul> <li> the final tournament features <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> teams (<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> is always even) </li><li> the first <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009/\u20092</span> teams (according to the standings) come through to the knockout stage </li><li> the standings are made on the following principle: for a victory a team gets 3 points, for a draw \u2014 1 point, for a defeat \u2014 0 points. In the first place, teams are ordered in the standings in decreasing order of their points; in the second place \u2014 in decreasing order of the difference between scored and missed goals; in the third place \u2014 in the decreasing order of scored goals </li><li> it's written in Berland's Constitution that the previous regulation helps to order the teams without ambiguity. </li></ul><p>You are asked to write a program that, by the given list of the competing teams and the results of all the matches, will find the list of teams that managed to get through to the knockout stage.</p>",

The following <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> lines contain the names of these teams, a name is a string of lower-case and upper-case Latin letters, its length doesn't exceed 30 characters.
