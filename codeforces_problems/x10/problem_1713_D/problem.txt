Such a tournament scheme is known as the single-elimination tournament.</p><p>You don't know the results, but you want to find the winner of the tournament. In one query, you select two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which are the indices of two contestants. The jury will return $$$1$$$ if $$$a$$$ won more matches than $$$b$$$, $$$2$$$ if $$$b$$$ won more matches than $$$a$$$, or $$$0$$$ if their number of wins was equal.</p><p>Find the winner in no more than $$$\\left \\lceil \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2^{n + 1} \\right \\rceil$$$ queries.
