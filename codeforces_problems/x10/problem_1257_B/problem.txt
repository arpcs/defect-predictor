        "statement": "<p>Recently Petya walked in the forest and found a magic stick.</p><p>Since Petya really likes numbers, the first thing he learned was spells for changing numbers. So far, he knows only two spells that can be applied to a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">positive</span> integer: </p><ol> <li> If the chosen number $$$a$$$ is even, then the spell will turn it into $$$\\frac{3a}{2}$$$; </li><li> If the chosen number $$$a$$$ is greater than one, then the spell will turn it into $$$a-1$$$. </li></ol><p>Note that if the number is even and greater than one, then Petya can choose which spell to apply.</p><p>Petya now has only one number $$$x$$$. He wants to know if his favorite number $$$y$$$ can be obtained from $$$x$$$ using the spells he knows. The spells can be used any number of times in any order. It is not required to use spells, Petya can leave $$$x$$$ as it is.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the current number and the number that Petya wants to get.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For the $$$i$$$-th test case print the answer on it \u2014 <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span> if Petya can get the number $$$y$$$ from the number $$$x$$$ using known spells, and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span> otherwise.</p><p>You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">yEs</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">yes</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Yes</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span> will all be recognized as positive answer).</p>",
