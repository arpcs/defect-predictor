In the video game, he will control Neko, the giant cat, to fly between planets in the Catniverse.</p><p>There are $$$n$$$ planets in the Catniverse, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. At the beginning of the game, Aki chooses the planet where Neko is initially located. Then Aki performs $$$k - 1$$$ moves, where in each move Neko is moved from the current planet $$$x$$$ to some other planet $$$y$$$ such that:</p><ul> <li> Planet $$$y$$$ is not visited yet. </li><li> $$$1 \\leq y \\leq x + m$$$ (where $$$m$$$ is a fixed constant given in the input) </li></ul><p>This way, Neko will visit exactly $$$k$$$ different planets. Two ways of visiting planets are called different if there is some index $$$i$$$ such that, the $$$i$$$-th planet visited in the first way is different from the $$$i$$$-th planet visited in the second way.</p><p>What is the total number of ways to visit $$$k$$$ planets this way? Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.</p>",
