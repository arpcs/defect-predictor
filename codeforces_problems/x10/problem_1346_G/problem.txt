        "statement": "<p>You have two IP cameras of the same model. Each camera can take photos starting from some moment of time with a fixed period. You can freely choose the starting moment but you can choose the period only as one of $$$k$$$ values $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$ which are chosen by the camera's manufacturer.</p><p>You have $$$n$$$ moments of interest $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$. You'd like to configure both cameras in such a way that at least one camera will take a photo in each of these moments. Configuring the camera means setting the moment when it takes the first photo and the gap between two consecutive photos (which should be one of the values $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$). It's not a problem for you that cameras can take photos at other moments of time\u00a0\u2014 you only care about moments of interest.</p>",
