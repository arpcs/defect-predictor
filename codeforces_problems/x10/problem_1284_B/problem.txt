        "statement": "<p>A sequence $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_l]$$$ of length $$$l$$$ has an <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">ascent</span> if there exists a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i &lt; j \\le l$$$ and $$$a_i &lt; a_j$$$. For example, the sequence $$$[0, 2, 0, 2, 0]$$$ has an ascent because of the pair $$$(1, 4)$$$, but the sequence $$$[4, 3, 3, 3, 1]$$$ doesn't have an ascent.</p><p>Let's call a concatenation of sequences $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ the sequence that is obtained by writing down sequences $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the $$$[0, 2, 0, 2, 0]$$$ and $$$[4, 3, 3, 3, 1]$$$ is the sequence $$$[0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1]$$$. The concatenation of sequences $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ is denoted as $$$p+q$$$.</p><p>Gyeonggeun thinks that sequences with ascents bring luck. Therefore, he wants to make many such sequences for the new year. Gyeonggeun has $$$n$$$ sequences $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$ which may have different lengths. </p><p>Gyeonggeun will consider all $$$n^2$$$ pairs of sequences $$$s_x$$$ and $$$s_y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$), and will check if its concatenation $$$s_x + s_y$$$ has an ascent. Note that he may select the same sequence twice, and the order of selection matters.</p><p>Please count the number of pairs ($$$x, y$$$) of sequences $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$ whose concatenation $$$s_x + s_y$$$ contains an ascent.</p>",
