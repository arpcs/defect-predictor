        "statement": "<p>You've gotten an <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>m</i></span> sheet of squared paper. Some of its squares are painted. Let's mark the set of all painted squares as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span>. Set <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> is connected. Your task is to find the minimum number of squares that we can delete from set <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> to make it not connected.</p><p>A set of painted squares is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">connected</span>, if for every two squares <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> from this set there is a sequence of squares from the set, beginning in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and ending in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>, such that in this sequence any square, except for the last one, shares a common side with the square that follows next in the sequence. An empty set and a set consisting of exactly one square are connected by definition.</p>",

It is guaranteed that the set of all painted squares <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> is connected and isn't empty.</p>",

To the right there is a set with deleted squares.
