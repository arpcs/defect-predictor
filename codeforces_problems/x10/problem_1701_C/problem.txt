Since they both are proficient in the corresponding tasks, they take $$$1$$$ hour on each. Both of them complete $$$2$$$ tasks in $$$2$$$ hours. Thus, all tasks are completed by $$$2$$$ hours.</p><p>In the second testcase, it's optimal to assign the first worker to tasks $$$1, 2$$$ and $$$3$$$ and the second worker to task $$$4$$$. The first worker spends $$$3$$$ hours, the second worker spends $$$2$$$ hours (since they are not proficient in the taken task).</p><p>In the third example, each worker can be assigned to the task they are proficient at. Thus, each of them complete their task in $$$1$$$ hour.</p>"
