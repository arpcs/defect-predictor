        "statement": "<p>Vasya has been playing Plane of Tanks with his friends the whole year. Now it is time to divide the participants into several categories depending on their results. </p><p>A player is given a non-negative integer number of points in each round of the Plane of Tanks. Vasya wrote results for each round of the last year. He has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> records in total.</p><p>In order to determine a player's category consider the best result obtained by the player and the best results of other players. The player belongs to category: </p><ul> <li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">noob</span>\" \u2014 if <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">more than <span class=\"tex-span\">50%</span> of players have better results</span>; </li><li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">random</span>\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that <span class=\"tex-span\">50%</span> of players have, but more than <span class=\"tex-span\">20%</span> of players have better results; </li><li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">average</span>\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that <span class=\"tex-span\">80%</span> of players have, but more than <span class=\"tex-span\">10%</span> of players have better results; </li><li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hardcore</span>\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that <span class=\"tex-span\">90%</span> of players have, but more than <span class=\"tex-span\">1%</span> of players have better results; </li><li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">pro</span>\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that <span class=\"tex-span\">99%</span> of players have. </li></ul> <p>When the percentage is calculated the player himself is taken into account. That means that if two players played the game and the first one gained 100 points and the second one 1000 points, then the first player's result is not worse than the result that <span class=\"tex-span\">50%</span> of players have, and the second one is not worse than the result that <span class=\"tex-span\">100%</span> of players have.</p><p>Vasya gave you the last year Plane of Tanks results.
