        "statement": "<p>During a daily walk Alina noticed a long number written on the ground. Now Alina wants to find some positive number of same length without leading zeroes, such that the sum of these two numbers is a palindrome. </p><p>Recall that a number is called a palindrome, if it reads the same right to left and left to right. For example, numbers $$$121, 66, 98989$$$ are palindromes, and $$$103, 239, 1241$$$ are not palindromes.</p><p>Alina understands that a valid number always exist. Help her find one!</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next, descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases follow.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$$$) \u2014 the length of the number that is written on the ground.</p><p>The second line of contains the positive $$$n$$$-digit integer without leading zeroes \u2014 the number itself.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100\\,000$$$.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each of $$$t$$$ test cases print an answer \u2014 a positive $$$n$$$-digit integer without leading zeros, such that the sum of the input integer and this number is a palindrome.</p><p>We can show that at least one number satisfying the constraints exists. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.</p>",
