For example, let heights of chosen people be $$$[a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots, a_{i_k}]$$$, where $$$k$$$ is the number of people you choose. Then the condition $$$|a_{i_j} - a_{i_{j + 1}}| \\le 1$$$ should be satisfied for all $$$j$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$ and the condition $$$|a_{i_1} - a_{i_k}| \\le 1$$$ should be also satisfied. $$$|x|$$$ means the absolute value of $$$x$$$. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced.</p><p>Your task is to choose the maximum number of people and construct a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">balanced circle</span> consisting of all chosen people. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced so the answer always exists.</p>",
