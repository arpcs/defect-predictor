        "statement": "<p>In Summer Informatics School, if a student doesn't behave well, teachers make a hole in his badge. And today one of the teachers caught a group of $$$n$$$ students doing yet another trick. </p><p>Let's assume that all these students are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The teacher came to student $$$a$$$ and put a hole in his badge. The student, however, claimed that the main culprit is some other student $$$p_a$$$.</p><p>After that, the teacher came to student $$$p_a$$$ and made a hole in his badge as well. The student in reply said that the main culprit was student $$$p_{p_a}$$$.</p><p>This process went on for a while, but, since the number of students was finite, eventually the teacher came to the student, who already had a hole in his badge.</p><p>After that, the teacher put a second hole in the student's badge and decided that he is done with this process, and went to the sauna.</p><p>You don't know the first student who was caught by the teacher. However, you know all the numbers $$$p_i$$$. Your task is to find out for every student $$$a$$$, who would be the student with two holes in the badge if the first caught student was $$$a$$$.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains the only integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the naughty students.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1$$$, ..., $$$p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ indicates the student who was reported to the teacher by student $$$i$$$.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For every student $$$a$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ print which student would receive two holes in the badge, if $$$a$$$ was the first student caught by the teacher.</p>",

When $$$a = 3$$$, the teacher will visit students $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ with student $$$3$$$ getting a second hole in his badge.</p><p>For the second example test case it's clear that no matter with whom the teacher starts, that student would be the one who gets the second hole in his badge.</p>"
