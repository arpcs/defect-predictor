        "note": "<p>Consider the following situation in the first example. Initially Toastman gets group [3, 1, 5] and adds 9 to the score, then he give the group to Appleman. Appleman splits group [3, 1, 5] into two groups: [3, 5] and [1]. Both of them should be given to Toastman. When Toastman receives group [1], he adds 1 to score and gives the group to Appleman (he will throw it out). When Toastman receives group [3, 5], he adds 8 to the score and gives the group to Appleman. Appleman splits [3, 5] in the only possible way: [5] and [3]. Then he gives both groups to Toastman. When Toastman receives [5], he adds 5 to the score and gives the group to Appleman (he will throws it out). When Toastman receives [3], he adds 3 to the score and gives the group to Appleman (he will throws it out). Finally Toastman have added 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 26 to the score. This is the optimal sequence of actions.</p>"
