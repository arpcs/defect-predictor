Your goal is to find the location of this zero, that is, to find $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i = 0$$$.</p><p>You are allowed to make several queries to guess the answer. For each query, you can think up three distinct indices $$$i, j, k$$$, and we will tell you the value of $$$\\max(a_i, a_j, a_k) - \\min(a_i, a_j, a_k)$$$. In other words, we will tell you the difference between the maximum and the minimum number among $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$ and $$$a_k$$$.</p><p>You are allowed to make no more than $$$2 \\cdot n - 2$$$ queries, and after that you have two tries to guess where the zero is. That is, you have to tell us two numbers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ and you win if $$$a_i = 0$$$ or $$$a_j = 0$$$.</p><p>Can you guess where we hid the zero?</p><p>Note that the array in each test case is fixed beforehand and will not change during the game. In other words, the interactor is not adaptive.</p>",
