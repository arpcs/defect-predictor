So when she is away, he marks two more unoccupied cells as occupied. He wants to do it in such a way that it will be impossible to fill all unoccupied cells with dominoes.</p><p>Help Dani to count the number of ways he can select these two cells. Since Dani can only count to one million, if this number of ways is $$$x$$$, output $$$\\min(x, 10^6)$$$.</p>",
