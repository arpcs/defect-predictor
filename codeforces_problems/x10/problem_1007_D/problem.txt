The $$$i$$$-th ant has two favorite pairs of vertices: ($$$a_i, b_i$$$) and ($$$c_i, d_i$$$). You need to tell if it is possible to paint the edges of the tree in $$$m$$$ colors so that every ant will be able to walk between vertices from one of its favorite pairs using only edges of his color; if it is possible, you need to print which pair every ant should use.</p>",
