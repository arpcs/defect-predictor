Your task is to make the sequence $$$a$$$ sorted (it is considered sorted if the condition $$$a_1 \\le a_2 \\le a_3 \\le \\dots \\le a_n$$$ holds).</p><p>To make the sequence sorted, you may perform the following operation any number of times you want (possibly zero): choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ and $$$a_i &gt; x$$$, and swap the values of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$x$$$.</p><p>For example, if $$$a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 1$$$, the following sequence of operations is possible:</p><ol> <li> choose $$$i = 2$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_2 &gt; x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 3, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 2$$$; </li><li> choose $$$i = 3$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_3 &gt; x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 2, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 3$$$; </li><li> choose $$$i = 4$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_4 &gt; x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]$$$, $$$x = 5$$$. </li></ol><p>Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform so that $$$a$$$ becomes sorted, or report that it is impossible.</p>",
