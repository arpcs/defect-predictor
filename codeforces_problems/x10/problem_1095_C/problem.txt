        "statement": "<p>A positive integer $$$x$$$ is called a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">power of two</span> if it can be represented as $$$x = 2^y$$$, where $$$y$$$ is a non-negative integer. So, the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">powers of two</span> are $$$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \\dots$$$.</p><p>You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Your task is to represent $$$n$$$ as the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">sum</span> of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$k$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">powers of two</span>.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>If it is impossible to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of $$$k$$$ powers of two, print <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>.</p><p>Otherwise, print <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>, and then print $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_k$$$ such that each of $$$b_i$$$ is a power of two, and $$$\\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{k} b_i = n$$$. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.</p>",
