        "statement": "<p>Authors have come up with the string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.</p><p>You are given two permutations of its indices (not necessary equal) $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ (both of length $$$n$$$). Recall that the permutation is the array of length $$$n$$$ which contains each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once.</p><p>For all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ the following properties hold: $$$s[p_i] \\le s[p_{i + 1}]$$$ and $$$s[q_i] \\le s[q_{i + 1}]$$$. It means that if you will write down all characters of $$$s$$$ in order of permutation indices, the resulting string will be sorted in the non-decreasing order.</p><p>Your task is to restore <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span> such string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least $$$k$$$ distinct lowercase Latin letters</span> which suits the given permutations.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.</p>",
