        "statement": "<p>Valera's lifelong ambition was to be a photographer, so he bought a new camera. Every day he got more and more clients asking for photos, and one day Valera needed a program that would determine the maximum number of people he can serve.</p><p>The camera's memory is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> megabytes. Valera's camera can take photos of high and low quality. One low quality photo takes <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> megabytes of memory, one high quality photo take <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> megabytes of memory. For unknown reasons, each client asks him to make several low quality photos and several high quality photos. More formally, the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th client asks to make <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> low quality photos and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> high quality photos.</p><p>Valera wants to serve as many clients per day as possible, provided that they will be pleased with his work. To please the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th client, Valera needs to give him everything he wants, that is, to make <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> low quality photos and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> high quality photos. To make one low quality photo, the camera must have at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> megabytes of free memory space. Similarly, to make one high quality photo, the camera must have at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> megabytes of free memory space. Initially the camera's memory is empty. Valera also does not delete photos from the camera so that the camera's memory gradually fills up.</p><p>Calculate the maximum number of clients Valera can successfully serve and print the numbers of these clients.</p>",
