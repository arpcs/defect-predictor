        "statement": "<p>You are given a board of size $$$n \\times n$$$, where $$$n$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">odd</span> (not divisible by $$$2$$$). Initially, each cell of the board contains one figure.</p><p>In one move, you can select <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one figure</span> presented in some cell and move it to one of the cells <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">sharing a side or a corner with the current cell</span>, i.e. from the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ you can move the figure to cells: </p><ul> <li> $$$(i - 1, j - 1)$$$; </li><li> $$$(i - 1, j)$$$; </li><li> $$$(i - 1, j + 1)$$$; </li><li> $$$(i, j - 1)$$$; </li><li> $$$(i, j + 1)$$$; </li><li> $$$(i + 1, j - 1)$$$; </li><li> $$$(i + 1, j)$$$; </li><li> $$$(i + 1, j + 1)$$$; </li></ul><p>Of course, you <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">can not</span> move figures to cells out of the board. It is allowed that after a move there will be several figures in one cell.</p><p>Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to get <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all the figures</span> into <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one</span> cell (i.e. $$$n^2-1$$$ cells should contain $$$0$$$ figures and one cell should contain $$$n^2$$$ figures).</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p>",

Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.</p><p>The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n &lt; 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the size of the board. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is odd (not divisible by $$$2$$$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\sum n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).</p>",
