        "statement": "<p>After Vitaly was expelled from the university, he became interested in the graph theory.</p><p>Vitaly especially liked the cycles of an odd length in which each vertex occurs at most once.</p><p>Vitaly was wondering how to solve the following problem. You are given an undirected graph consisting of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> vertices and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> \u2014 the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>w</i></span> \u2014 the number of ways to add <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.</p><p>Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.</p><p>Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> (<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/85eb1262062bdd96de2d3ee9a76a845441ee44af.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.</p><p>Next <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>,\u2009<i>b</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i></span>)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the vertices that are connected by the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th edge.
