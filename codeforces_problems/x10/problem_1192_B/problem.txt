        "statement": "<p>You are given a weighted undirected tree on $$$n$$$ vertices and a list of $$$q$$$ updates. Each update changes the weight of one edge. The task is to output the diameter of the tree after each update.</p><p>(The distance between two vertices is the sum of the weights on the unique simple path that connects them. The diameter is the largest of all those distances.)</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains three space-separated integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ and $$$w$$$\u00a0($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100,000, 1 \\leq q \\leq 100,000$$$, $$$1 \\leq w \\leq 20,000,000,000,000$$$) \u2013 the number of vertices in the tree, the number of updates and the limit on the weights of edges. The vertices are numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$.</p><p>Next, $$$n-1$$$ lines describing the initial tree follow. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$\u00a0($$$1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq c_i &lt; w$$$) meaning that initially, there is an edge between vertices $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ with weight $$$c_i$$$. It is guaranteed that these $$$n-1$$$ lines describe a tree.</p><p>Finally, $$$q$$$ lines describing queries follow. The $$$j$$$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $$$d_j$$$, $$$e_j$$$\u00a0($$$0 \\leq d_j &lt; n - 1, 0 \\leq e_j &lt; w$$$). These two integers are then transformed according to the following scheme: </p><ul> <li> $$$d'_j = (d_j + last) \\bmod (n - 1)$$$ </li><li> $$$e'_j = (e_j + last) \\bmod w$$$ </li></ul> where $$$last$$$ is the result of the last query (initially $$$last=0$$$). Tuple $$$(d'_j, e'_j)$$$ represents a query which takes the $$$d'_j+1$$$-th edge from the input and sets its weight to $$$e'_j$$$.",

The largest distance between any pair of vertices is $$$2030$$$ \u2013 the distance between $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$.</p><p>As the answer is $$$2030$$$, the second query is $$$$$$d'_2 = (1 + 2030) \\bmod 3 = 0$$$$$$ $$$$$$e'_2 = (1020 + 2030) \\bmod 2000 = 1050$$$$$$ Hence the weight of the edge $$$\\{1, 2\\}$$$ is changed to $$$1050$$$. This causes the pair $$$\\{1, 4\\}$$$ to be the pair with the greatest distance, namely $$$2080$$$.</p><p>The third query is decoded as $$$$$$d'_3 = (1 + 2080) \\bmod 3 = 2$$$$$$ $$$$$$e'_3 = (890 + 2080) \\bmod 2000 = 970$$$$$$ As the weight of the edge $$$\\{2, 4\\}$$$ decreases to $$$970$$$, the most distant pair is suddenly $$$\\{1, 3\\}$$$ with $$$2050$$$.</p>"
