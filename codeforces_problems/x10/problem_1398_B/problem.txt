        "statement": "<p>Alice and Bob play a game. They have a binary string $$$s$$$ (a string such that each character in it is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$). Alice moves first, then Bob, then Alice again, and so on.</p><p>During their move, the player can choose any number (not less than one) of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">consecutive equal characters</span> in $$$s$$$ and delete them.</p><p>For example, if the string is $$$10110$$$, there are $$$6$$$ possible moves (deleted characters are bold):</p><ol> <li> $$$\\textbf{1}0110 \\to 0110$$$; </li><li> $$$1\\textbf{0}110 \\to 1110$$$; </li><li> $$$10\\textbf{1}10 \\to 1010$$$; </li><li> $$$101\\textbf{1}0 \\to 1010$$$; </li><li> $$$10\\textbf{11}0 \\to 100$$$; </li><li> $$$1011\\textbf{0} \\to 1011$$$. </li></ol><p>After the characters are removed, the characters to the left and to the right of the removed block become adjacent. I.\u2009e. the following sequence of moves is valid: $$$10\\textbf{11}0 \\to 1\\textbf{00} \\to 1$$$.</p><p>The game ends when the string becomes empty, and the score of each player is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the number of $$$1$$$-characters deleted by them</span>.</p><p>Each player wants to maximize their score.
