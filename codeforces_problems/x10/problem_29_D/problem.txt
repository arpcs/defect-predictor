        "statement": "<p>Connected undirected graph without cycles is called a tree. Trees is a class of graphs which is interesting not only for people, but for ants too.</p><p>An ant stands at the root of some tree. He sees that there are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> vertexes in the tree, and they are connected by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> edges so that there is a path between any pair of vertexes. A leaf is a distinct from root vertex, which is connected with exactly one other vertex.</p><p>The ant wants to visit every vertex in the tree and return to the root, passing every edge twice. In addition, he wants to visit the leaves in a specific order. You are to find some possible route of the ant.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>\u2009\u2264\u2009300</span>) \u2014 amount of vertexes in the tree. Next <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> lines describe edges. Each edge is described with two integers \u2014 indexes of vertexes which it connects. Each edge can be passed in any direction. Vertexes are numbered starting from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. The root of the tree has number <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. The last line contains <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> integers, where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> is amount of leaves in the tree. These numbers describe the order in which the leaves should be visited. It is guaranteed that each leaf appears in this order exactly once.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>If the required route doesn't exist, output <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-1</span>. Otherwise, output <span class=\"tex-span\">2<i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> numbers, describing the route. Every time the ant comes to a vertex, output it's index.</p>",
