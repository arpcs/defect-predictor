        "statement": "<p>Kuroni isn't good at economics. So he decided to found a new financial pyramid called <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Antihype</span>. It has the following rules:</p><ol> <li> You can join the pyramid for free and get $$$0$$$ coins. </li><li> If you are already a member of Antihype, you can invite your friend who is currently not a member of Antihype, and get a number of coins equal to your age (for each friend you invite). </li></ol><p>$$$n$$$ people have heard about Antihype recently, the $$$i$$$-th person's age is $$$a_i$$$. Some of them are friends, but friendship is a weird thing now: the $$$i$$$-th person is a friend of the $$$j$$$-th person <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">if and only if</span> $$$a_i \\text{ AND } a_j = 0$$$, where $$$\\text{AND}$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND\">bitwise AND operation</a>.</p><p>Nobody among the $$$n$$$ people is a member of Antihype at the moment. They want to cooperate to join and invite each other to Antihype in a way that maximizes their combined gainings. Could you help them? </p>",
