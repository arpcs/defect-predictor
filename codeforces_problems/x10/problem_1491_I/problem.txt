        "statement": "<p>After realizing that Zookeeper is just a duck, the animals have overthrown Zookeeper. They now have to decide a new ruler among themselves through a fighting tournament of the following format:</p><p>Initially, animal $$$0$$$ is king, while everyone else queues up with animal $$$1$$$ at the front of the queue and animal $$$n-1$$$ at the back. The animal at the front of the queue will challenge the king to a fight, and the animal with greater strength will win the fight. The winner will become king, while the loser joins the back of the queue.</p><p>An animal who <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">wins $$$3$$$ times consecutively</span> will be crowned ruler for the whole zoo. The strength of each animal depends on how many consecutive fights he won. Animal $$$i$$$ has strength $$$A_i$$$ with $$$0$$$ consecutive win, $$$B_i$$$ with $$$1$$$ consecutive win, and $$$C_i$$$ with $$$2$$$ consecutive wins. Initially, everyone has $$$0$$$ consecutive win.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">For all animals, $$$A_i &gt; B_i$$$ and $$$C_i &gt; B_i$$$</span>. Also, the values of $$$A_i$$$, $$$B_i$$$, $$$C_i$$$ are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span> (all $$$3n$$$ values are pairwise different). </p><p>In other words, an animal who is not a king has strength $$$A_i$$$. A king usually has a strength of $$$B_i$$$ or $$$C_i$$$. The exception is on the first turn, the first king (animal $$$0$$$) has strength $$$A_i$$$.</p><p>Who is the new ruler, and after how many fights? Or will it end up that animals fight forever with no one ending up as ruler?</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\leq n \\leq 6000$$$) \u2014 number of the animals. </p><p>$$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$A_i$$$, $$$B_i$$$ and $$$C_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq A_i, B_i, C_i \\leq 10^9$$$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that $$$A_i &gt; B_i$$$ and $$$C_i &gt; B_i$$$, and that all values of $$$A_i$$$, $$$B_i$$$ and $$$C_i$$$ are distinct.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>Output two integers in a single line. The first is the index of the animal that will become ruler, and the second is the number of fights passed until some animal becomes the ruler.</p><p>If the animals will fight for infinitely long, output <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-1 -1</span> instead.</p>",
