        "statement": "<p>There is a country with $$$n$$$ citizens. The $$$i$$$-th of them initially has $$$a_{i}$$$ money. The government strictly controls the wealth of its citizens. Whenever a citizen makes a purchase or earns some money, they must send a receipt to the social services mentioning the amount of money they currently have.</p><p>Sometimes the government makes payouts to the poor: all citizens who have strictly less money than $$$x$$$ are paid accordingly so that after the payout they have exactly $$$x$$$ money. In this case the citizens don't send a receipt.</p><p>You know the initial wealth of every citizen and the log of all events: receipts and payouts. Restore the amount of money each citizen has after all events.</p>",
