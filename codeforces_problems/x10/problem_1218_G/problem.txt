        "title": "G. Alpha planetary system",
        "statement": "<p>Three planets $$$X$$$, $$$Y$$$ and $$$Z$$$ within the Alpha planetary system are inhabited with an advanced civilization. The spaceports of these planets are connected by interplanetary space shuttles. The flight scheduler should decide between $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ return flights for every existing space shuttle connection. Since the residents of Alpha are strong opponents of the symmetry, there is a strict rule that any two of the spaceports connected by a shuttle must have a different number of flights. </p><p>For every pair of connected spaceports, your goal is to propose a number $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ or $$$3$$$ for each shuttle flight, so that for every two connected spaceports the overall number of flights differs. </p><p>You may assume that:</p><p>1) Every planet has at least one spaceport </p><p>2) There exist only shuttle flights between spaceports of different planets </p><p>3) For every two spaceports there is a series of shuttle flights enabling traveling between them</p><p>4) Spaceports are not connected by more than one shuttle</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first row of the input is the integer number $$$N$$$ $$$(3 \\leq N \\leq 100 000)$$$, representing overall number of spaceports. The second row is the integer number $$$M$$$ $$$(2 \\leq M \\leq 100 000)$$$ representing number of shuttle flight connections. </p><p>Third row contains $$$N$$$ characters from the set $$$\\{X, Y, Z\\}$$$. Letter on $$$I^{th}$$$ position indicates on which planet is situated spaceport $$$I$$$. For example, \"XYYXZZ\" indicates that the spaceports $$$0$$$ and $$$3$$$ are located at planet $$$X$$$, spaceports $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ are located at $$$Y$$$, and spaceports $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ are at $$$Z$$$. </p><p>Starting from the fourth row, every row contains two integer numbers separated by a whitespace. These numbers are natural numbers smaller than $$$N$$$ and indicate the numbers of the spaceports that are connected. For example, \"$$$12\\ 15$$$\" indicates that there is a shuttle flight between spaceports $$$12$$$ and $$$15$$$. </p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>The same representation of shuttle flights in separate rows as in the input, but also containing a third number from the set $$$\\{1, 2, 3\\}$$$ standing for the number of shuttle flights between these spaceports.</p>",
