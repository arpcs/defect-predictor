        "statement": "<p>The store sells $$$n$$$ beads. The color of each bead is described by a lowercase letter of the English alphabet (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\"\u2013\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">z</span>\"). You want to buy some beads to assemble a necklace from them.</p><p>A necklace is a set of beads connected in a circle.</p><p>For example, if the store sells beads \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>\", then you can assemble the following necklaces (these are not all possible options):</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/489ef8e534a70fc3e0e5051863a91dd875fce89a.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>And the following necklaces cannot be assembled from beads sold in the store:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/35fbf7bd3f4923b6d7a03918403df2c496864799.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">The first necklace cannot be assembled because it has three beads \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\" (of the two available). The second necklace cannot be assembled because it contains a bead \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">d</span>\", which is not sold in the store.</span> </center><p>We call a necklace $$$k$$$-beautiful if, when it is turned clockwise by $$$k$$$ beads, the necklace remains unchanged. For example, here is a sequence of three turns of a necklace. </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/d00132704b1299bdef457071855b4150205c2447.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center> As you can see, this necklace is, for example, $$$3$$$-beautiful, $$$6$$$-beautiful, $$$9$$$-beautiful, and so on, but it is not $$$1$$$-beautiful or $$$2$$$-beautiful.<p>In particular, a necklace of length $$$1$$$ is $$$k$$$-beautiful for any integer $$$k$$$. A necklace that consists of beads of the same color is also beautiful for any $$$k$$$.</p><p>You are given the integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, and also the string $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet\u00a0\u2014 each letter defines a bead in the store. You can buy any subset of beads and connect them in any order. Find the maximum length of a $$$k$$$-beautiful necklace you can assemble.</p>",
