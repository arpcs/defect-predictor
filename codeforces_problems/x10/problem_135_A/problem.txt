Recently he has received one such array as a gift from his mother. Petya didn't like it at once. He decided to choose exactly one element from the array and replace it with another integer that also lies in the range from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup></span>, inclusive. It is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not allowed</span> to replace a number with itself or to change no number at all. </p><p>After the replacement Petya sorted the array by the numbers' non-decreasing. Now he wants to know for each position: what minimum number could occupy it after the replacement and the sorting.</p>",
