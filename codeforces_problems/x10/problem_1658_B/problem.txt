        "statement": "<p>Marin wants you to count number of permutations that are <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beautiful</span>. A <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beautiful</span> permutation of length $$$n$$$ is a permutation that has the following property: $$$$$$ \\gcd (1 \\cdot p_1, \\, 2 \\cdot p_2, \\, \\dots, \\, n \\cdot p_n) &gt; 1, $$$$$$ where $$$\\gcd$$$ is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor\">greatest common divisor</a>.</p><p>A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3, 4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).</p>",

        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print one integer \u2014 number of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beautiful</span> permutations. Because the answer can be very big, please print the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",
