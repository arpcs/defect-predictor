        "statement": "<p>Gildong is now developing a puzzle game. The puzzle consists of $$$n$$$ platforms numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The player plays the game as a character that can stand on each platform and the goal of the game is to move the character from the $$$1$$$-st platform to the $$$n$$$-th platform.</p><p>The $$$i$$$-th platform is labeled with an integer $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n-i$$$). When the character is standing on the $$$i$$$-th platform, the player can move the character to any of the $$$j$$$-th platforms where $$$i+1 \\le j \\le i+a_i$$$. If the character is on the $$$i$$$-th platform where $$$a_i=0$$$ and $$$i \\ne n$$$, the player loses the game.</p><p>Since Gildong thinks the current game is not hard enough, he wants to make it even harder. He wants to change some (possibly zero) labels to $$$0$$$ so that there remains exactly one way to win. He wants to modify the game as little as possible, so he's asking you to find the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> number of platforms that should have their labels changed. Two ways are different if and only if there exists a platform the character gets to in one way but not in the other way.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$).</p><p>Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 3000$$$) \u2014 the number of platforms of the game.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer is $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n-i$$$) \u2014 the integer of the $$$i$$$-th platform.</p><p>It is guaranteed that: </p><ul> <li> For each test case, there is at least one way to win initially. </li><li> The sum of $$$n$$$ in all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3000$$$. </li></ul>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of different labels that should be changed to $$$0$$$ so that there remains exactly one way to win.</p>",

        ],
        "note": "<p>In the first case, the player can only move to the next platform until they get to the $$$4$$$-th platform. Since there is already only one way to win, the answer is zero.</p><p>In the second case, Gildong can change $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_3$$$, and $$$a_4$$$ to $$$0$$$ so that the game becomes $$$4$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$. Now the only way the player can win is to move directly from the $$$1$$$-st platform to the $$$5$$$-th platform.</p><p>In the third case, Gildong can change $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_8$$$ to $$$0$$$, then the only way to win is to move in the following way: $$$1$$$ \u2013 $$$3$$$ \u2013 $$$7$$$ \u2013 $$$9$$$.</p>"
