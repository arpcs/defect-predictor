A <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">trip</span> of length $$$k$$$ is a sequence of $$$k+1$$$ cities $$$v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{k+1}$$$ such that there is a road connecting each consecutive pair $$$v_i$$$, $$$v_{i+1}$$$ of cities, for all $$$1 \\le i \\le k$$$. A <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">special trip</span> is a trip that does not use the same road twice in a row, i.e., a sequence of $$$k+1$$$ cities $$$v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{k+1}$$$ such that it forms a trip and $$$v_i \\neq v_{i + 2}$$$, for all $$$1 \\le i \\le k - 1$$$.</p><p>Given an integer $$$k$$$, compute the number of distinct special trips of length $$$k$$$ which begin and end in the same city.
