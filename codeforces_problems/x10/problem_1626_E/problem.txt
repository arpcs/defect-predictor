        "statement": "<p>You are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Some of the vertices (at least two) are black, all the other vertices are white.</p><p>You place a chip on one of the vertices of the tree, and then perform the following operations:</p><ul> <li> let the current vertex where the chip is located is $$$x$$$. You choose a black vertex $$$y$$$, and then move the chip along the first edge on the simple path from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$. </li></ul><p>You are not allowed to choose the same black vertex $$$y$$$ in two operations in a row (i.\u2009e., for every two consecutive operations, the chosen black vertex should be different).</p><p>You end your operations when the chip moves to the black vertex (if it is initially placed in a black vertex, you don't perform the operations at all), or when the number of performed operations exceeds $$$100^{500}$$$.</p><p>For every vertex $$$i$$$, you have to determine if there exists a (possibly empty) sequence of operations that moves the chip to some black vertex, if the chip is initially placed on the vertex $$$i$$$.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_i \\le 1$$$), where $$$c_i = 0$$$ means that the $$$i$$$-th vertex is white, and $$$c_i = 1$$$ means that the $$$i$$$-th vertex is black. At least two values of $$$c_i$$$ are equal to $$$1$$$.</p><p>Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, each of them contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$$$; $$$u_i \\ne v_i$$$) \u2014 the endpoints of some edge. These edges form a tree.</p>",
