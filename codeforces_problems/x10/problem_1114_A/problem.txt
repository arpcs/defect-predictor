To make all of them happy, the following should happen:</p><ul><li> Andrew, Dmitry and Michal should eat at least $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$ grapes, respectively.</li><li> Andrew has an extreme affinity for green grapes, thus he will eat green grapes and green grapes only.</li><li> On the other hand, Dmitry is not a fan of black grapes\u00a0\u2014 any types of grapes except black would do for him. In other words, Dmitry can eat green and purple grapes.</li><li> Michal has a common taste\u00a0\u2014 he enjoys grapes in general and will be pleased with any types of grapes, as long as the quantity is sufficient.</li></ul><p>Knowing that his friends are so fond of grapes, Aki decided to host a grape party with them. He has prepared a box with $$$a$$$ green grapes, $$$b$$$ purple grapes and $$$c$$$ black grapes.</p><p>However, Aki isn't sure if the box he prepared contains enough grapes to make everyone happy. Can you please find out whether it's possible to distribute grapes so that everyone is happy or Aki has to buy some more grapes?</p><p>It is not required to distribute all the grapes, so it's possible that some of them will remain unused.</p>",
