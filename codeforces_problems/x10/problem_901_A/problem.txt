        "statement": "<p>Sasha is taking part in a programming competition. In one of the problems she should check if some rooted trees are isomorphic or not. She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">0</sub>,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>h</i></sub></span>, where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>h</i></span> is the height of the tree, and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> edges from root. </p><p>Unfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree.</p><p>Two rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal.</p><p>The height of a rooted tree is the maximum number of edges on a path from the root to any other vertex.</p>",
