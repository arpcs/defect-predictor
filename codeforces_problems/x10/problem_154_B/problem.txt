        "statement": "<p>By 2312 there were <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.</p><p>In 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.</p><p>Upon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).</p><p>Initially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.</p><p>To the request of \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+ i</span>\" (that is, to activate the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: </p><ul> <li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Success</span>\" if the activation was successful. </li><li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Already on</span>\", if the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th collider was already activated before the request. </li><li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Conflict with j</span>\", if there is a conflict with the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>j</i></span>-th collider (that is, the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>j</i></span>-th collider is on, and numbers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>j</i></span> are not relatively prime). In this case, the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. </li></ul><p>The request of \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">- i</span>\" (that is, to deactivate the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: </p><ul> <li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Success</span>\", if the deactivation was successful. </li><li> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Already off</span>\", if the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th collider was already deactivated before the request. </li></ul><p>You don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.</p>",
