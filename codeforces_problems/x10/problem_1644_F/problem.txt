The result of this function is the array containing $$$|a|$$$ first elements of the array that you get by replacing each element of $$$a$$$ with exactly $$$k$$$ copies of that element.<p>For example, $$$F([2, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8], 2)$$$ is calculated as follows: first, you replace each element of the array with $$$2$$$ copies of it, so you obtain $$$[2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8]$$$. Then, you take the first $$$7$$$ elements of the array you obtained, so the result of the function is $$$[2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3]$$$.</p></li><li> $$$G(a, x, y)$$$ is a function that takes an array of integers $$$a$$$ and two <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. The result of this function is the array $$$a$$$ with every element equal to $$$x$$$ replaced by $$$y$$$, and every element equal to $$$y$$$ replaced by $$$x$$$.<p>For example, $$$G([1, 1, 2, 3, 5], 3, 1) = [3, 3, 2, 1, 5]$$$.</p></li></ul><p>An array $$$a$$$ is a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">parent</span> of the array $$$b$$$ if:</p><ul> <li> either there exists a positive integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$F(a, k) = b$$$; </li><li> or there exist two different integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$G(a, x, y) = b$$$. </li></ul><p>An array $$$a$$$ is an <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">ancestor</span> of the array $$$b$$$ if there exists a finite sequence of arrays $$$c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_m$$$ ($$$m \\ge 0$$$) such that $$$c_0$$$ is $$$a$$$, $$$c_m$$$ is $$$b$$$, and for every $$$i \\in [1, m]$$$, $$$c_{i-1}$$$ is a parent of $$$c_i$$$.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">And now, the problem itself</span>.</p><p>You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.
