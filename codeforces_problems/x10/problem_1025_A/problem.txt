        "statement": "<p>Panic is rising in the committee for doggo standardization\u00a0\u2014 the puppies of the new brood have been born multi-colored! In total there are 26 possible colors of puppies in the nature and they are denoted by letters from '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>' to '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">z</span>' inclusive.</p><p>The committee rules strictly prohibit even the smallest diversity between doggos and hence all the puppies should be of the same color. Thus Slava, the committee employee, has been assigned the task to recolor some puppies into other colors in order to eliminate the difference and make all the puppies have one common color.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic reasons and restricted budget, there's only one operation Slava can perform: he can choose a color $$$x$$$ such that there are currently <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least two</span> puppies of color $$$x$$$ and recolor <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all</span> puppies of the color $$$x$$$ into some arbitrary color $$$y$$$. Luckily, this operation can be applied multiple times (including zero).</p><p>For example, if the number of puppies is $$$7$$$ and their colors are represented as the string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abababc</span>\", then in one operation Slava can get the results \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">zbzbzbc</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bbbbbbc</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aaaaaac</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">acacacc</span>\" and others. However, if the current color sequence is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abababc</span>\", then he can't choose $$$x$$$='<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>' right now, because currently only one puppy has the color '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>'.</p><p>Help Slava and the committee determine whether it is possible to standardize all the puppies, i.e. after Slava's operations all the puppies should have the same color.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of puppies.</p><p>The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where the $$$i$$$-th symbol denotes the $$$i$$$-th puppy's color.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>If it's possible to recolor all puppies into one color, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Yes</span>\".</p><p>Otherwise print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">No</span>\".</p><p>Output the answer without quotation signs.</p>",

        "note": "<p>In the first example Slava can perform the following steps: </p><ol> <li> take all puppies of color '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>' (a total of two) and recolor them into '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>'; </li><li> take all puppies of color '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">d</span>' (a total of two) and recolor them into '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>'; </li><li> take all puppies of color '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>' (three puppies for now) and recolor them into '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>'. </li></ol><p>In the second example it's impossible to recolor any of the puppies.</p><p>In the third example all the puppies' colors are the same; thus there's no need to recolor anything.</p>"
