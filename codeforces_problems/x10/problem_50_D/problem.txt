You are ordered to determine the power of the warhead that needs to be used.</p><p>The enemy has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>N</i></span> strategically important objects. Their positions are known due to the intelligence service. The aim of the strike is to deactivate at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>K</i></span> important objects of the enemy. The bombing impact point is already determined and has coordinates of <span class=\"tex-span\">[<i>X</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">0</sub>; <i>Y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">0</sub>]</span>.</p><p>The nuclear warhead is marked by the estimated impact radius <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>R</i>\u2009\u2265\u20090</span>. All the buildings that are located closer than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>R</i></span> to the bombing epicentre will be destroyed. All the buildings that are located further than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>R</i></span> from the epicentre, can also be deactivated with some degree of probability. Let's assume that <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>D</i></span> is the distance between a building and the epicentre. This building's deactivation probability <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>P</i>(<i>D</i>,\u2009<i>R</i>)</span> is calculated according to the following formula: </p><center class=\"tex-equation\"><img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/6a47db42daca2851e527aeb9e0299a54dbdbb14e.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></center> We should regard <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/41aacee1a62f5625b89e49dc310098043aaab520.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>e</i><sup class=\"upper-index\"><i>a</i></sup></span>, where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>e</i>\u2009\u2248\u20092.7182818284590452353602874713527</span><p>If the estimated impact radius of the warhead is equal to zero, then all the buildings located in the impact point will be completely demolished and all the rest of important objects will not be damaged.</p><p>The commanding officers want the probability of failing the task to be no more than <span class=\"tex-span\">\u03b5</span>. Nuclear warheads are too expensive a luxury, that's why you have to minimise the estimated impact radius of the warhead. </p>",
