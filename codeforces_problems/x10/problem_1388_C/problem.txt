        "statement": "<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Uncle Bogdan is in captain Flint's crew for a long time and sometimes gets nostalgic for his homeland. Today he told you how his country introduced a happiness index.</span></p><p>There are $$$n$$$ cities and $$$n\u22121$$$ undirected roads connecting pairs of cities. Citizens of any city can reach any other city traveling by these roads. Cities are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and the city $$$1$$$ is a capital. In other words, the country has a tree structure.</p><p>There are $$$m$$$ citizens living in the country. A $$$p_i$$$ people live in the $$$i$$$-th city but all of them are working in the capital. At evening all citizens return to their home cities using the shortest paths. </p><p>Every person has its own mood: somebody leaves his workplace in good mood but somebody are already in bad mood. Moreover any person can ruin his mood on the way to the hometown. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">If person is in bad mood he won't improve it</span>.</p><p>Happiness detectors are installed in each city to monitor the happiness of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">each</span> person who visits the city. The detector in the $$$i$$$-th city calculates a happiness index $$$h_i$$$ as the number of people in good mood minus the number of people in bad mood. Let's say for the simplicity that <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">mood of a person doesn't change inside the city</span>.</p><p>Happiness detector is still in development, so there is a probability of a mistake in judging a person's happiness. One late evening, when all citizens successfully returned home, the government asked uncle Bogdan (the best programmer of the country) to check the correctness of the collected happiness indexes.</p><p>Uncle Bogdan successfully solved the problem. Can you do the same?</p><p>More formally, <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">You need to check: \"Is it possible that, after all people return home, for each city $$$i$$$ the happiness index will be equal exactly to $$$h_i$$$\".</span></p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\le m \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities and citizens.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_{n}$$$ ($$$0 \\le p_i \\le m$$$; $$$p_1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_{n} = m$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the number of people living in the $$$i$$$-th city.</p><p>The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_{n}$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le h_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the calculated happiness index of the $$$i$$$-th city.</p><p>Next $$$n \u2212 1$$$ lines contain description of the roads, one per line. Each line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$; $$$x_i \\neq y_i$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are cities connected by the $$$i$$$-th road.</p><p>It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ from all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
