If the person with the number $$$2$$$ is looking at the person with the number $$$3$$$, the circle consists of $$$2$$$ people because these persons are neighbors. But, in this case, they must have the numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, but it doesn't meet the problem's conditions.</p><p>In the third test case, the only circle with the persons with the numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ looking at each other consists of $$$4$$$ people. Therefore, the person with the number $$$10$$$ doesn't occur in the circle.</p>"
