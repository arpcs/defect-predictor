        "statement": "<p>Two integer sequences existed initially \u2014 one of them was <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly</span> increasing, and the other one \u2014 <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly</span> decreasing.</p><p>Strictly increasing sequence is a sequence of integers $$$[x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; x_k]$$$. And strictly decreasing sequence is a sequence of integers $$$[y_1 &gt; y_2 &gt; \\dots &gt; y_l]$$$. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.</p><p>They were merged into one sequence $$$a$$$. After that sequence $$$a$$$ got shuffled. For example, some of the possible resulting sequences $$$a$$$ for an increasing sequence $$$[1, 3, 4]$$$ and a decreasing sequence $$$[10, 4, 2]$$$ are sequences $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 10]$$$ or $$$[4, 2, 1, 10, 4, 3]$$$.</p><p>This shuffled sequence $$$a$$$ is given in the input.</p><p>Your task is to find <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span> two suitable initial sequences. One of them should be <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly</span> increasing and the other one \u2014 <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly</span> decreasing. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.</p><p>If there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $$$a$$$ to increasing and decreasing sequences, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\".</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of elements in $$$a$$$.</p><p>The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>If there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $$$a$$$ to increasing and decreasing sequences, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" in the first line.</p><p>Otherwise print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" in the first line and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span> two suitable sequences. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.</p><p>In the second line print $$$n_i$$$ \u2014 the number of elements in the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly increasing</span> sequence. $$$n_i$$$ can be zero, in this case the increasing sequence is empty.</p><p>In the third line print $$$n_i$$$ integers $$$inc_1, inc_2, \\dots, inc_{n_i}$$$ in the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">increasing</span> order of its values ($$$inc_1 &lt; inc_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; inc_{n_i}$$$) \u2014 the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly increasing</span> sequence itself. You can keep this line empty if $$$n_i = 0$$$ (or just print the empty line).</p><p>In the fourth line print $$$n_d$$$ \u2014 the number of elements in the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly decreasing</span> sequence. $$$n_d$$$ can be zero, in this case the decreasing sequence is empty.</p><p>In the fifth line print $$$n_d$$$ integers $$$dec_1, dec_2, \\dots, dec_{n_d}$$$ in the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">decreasing</span> order of its values ($$$dec_1 &gt; dec_2 &gt; \\dots &gt; dec_{n_d}$$$) \u2014 the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly decreasing</span> sequence itself. You can keep this line empty if $$$n_d = 0$$$ (or just print the empty line).</p><p>$$$n_i + n_d$$$ should be equal to $$$n$$$ and the union of printed sequences should be a permutation of the given sequence (in case of \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" answer).</p>",
