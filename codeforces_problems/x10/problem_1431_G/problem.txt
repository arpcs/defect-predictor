During each turn, the following events happen:</p><ol> <li> firstly, Alice chooses an integer from the set. She can choose any integer <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">except for the maximum one</span>. Let the integer chosen by Alice be $$$a$$$; </li><li> secondly, Bob chooses an integer from the set. He can choose any integer <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">that is greater than $$$a$$$</span>. Let the integer chosen by Bob be $$$b$$$; </li><li> finally, both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are erased from the set, and the value of $$$b - a$$$ is added to the score of the game. </li></ol><p>Initially, the score is $$$0$$$.
