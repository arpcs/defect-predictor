        "statement": "<p>You are given $$$n$$$ points on the plane. The polygon formed from all the $$$n$$$ points is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly convex</span>, that is, the polygon is convex, and there are no three collinear points (i.e. lying in the same straight line). The points are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, in clockwise order.</p><p>We define the distance between two points $$$p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$$$ as their Manhattan distance: $$$$$$d(p_1, p_2) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|.$$$$$$</p><p>Furthermore, we define the perimeter of a polygon, as the sum of Manhattan distances between all adjacent pairs of points on it; if the points on the polygon are ordered as $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$$$ $$$(k \\geq 3)$$$, then the perimeter of the polygon is $$$d(p_1, p_2) + d(p_2, p_3) + \\ldots + d(p_k, p_1)$$$.</p><p>For some parameter $$$k$$$, let's consider all the polygons that can be formed from the given set of points, having <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span> $$$k$$$ vertices, such that the polygon is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> self-intersecting. For each such polygon, let's consider its perimeter. Over all such perimeters, we define $$$f(k)$$$ to be the maximal perimeter.</p><p>Please note, when checking whether a polygon is self-intersecting, that the edges of a polygon are still drawn as straight lines. For instance, in the following pictures:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/263d6c91bc7d93e97704fc2e0b8e69a1a28d0e77.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>In the middle polygon, the order of points ($$$p_1, p_3, p_2, p_4$$$) is not valid, since it is a self-intersecting polygon. The right polygon (whose edges resemble the Manhattan distance) has the same order and is not self-intersecting, but we consider edges as straight lines. The correct way to draw this polygon is ($$$p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$$$), which is the left polygon.</p><p>Your task is to compute $$$f(3), f(4), \\ldots, f(n)$$$. In other words, find the maximum possible perimeter for each possible number of points (i.e. $$$3$$$ to $$$n$$$).</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 3\\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points. </p><p>Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^8 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^8$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of point $$$p_i$$$.</p><p>The set of points is guaranteed to be convex, all points are distinct, the points are ordered in clockwise order, and there will be no three collinear points.</p>",
