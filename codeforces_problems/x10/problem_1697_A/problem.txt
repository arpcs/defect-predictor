        "statement": "<p>You are walking through a parkway near your house. The parkway has $$$n+1$$$ benches in a row numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n+1$$$ from left to right. The distance between the bench $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ is $$$a_i$$$ meters.</p><p>Initially, you have $$$m$$$ units of energy. To walk $$$1$$$ meter of distance, you spend $$$1$$$ unit of your energy. You can't walk if you have no energy. Also, you can restore your energy by <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">sitting on benches</span> (and this is the only way to restore the energy). When you are sitting, you can restore any integer amount of energy you want (if you sit longer, you restore more energy). Note that the amount of your energy <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">can exceed</span> $$$m$$$.</p><p>Your task is to find the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> amount of energy you have to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">restore</span> (by sitting on benches) to reach the bench $$$n+1$$$ from the bench $$$1$$$ (and end your walk).</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.</p><p>The first line of the test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 10^4$$$).</p><p>The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the distance between benches $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> amount of energy you have to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">restore</span> (by sitting on benches) to reach the bench $$$n+1$$$ from the bench $$$1$$$ (and end your walk) in the corresponding test case.</p>",
