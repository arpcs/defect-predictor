        "statement": "<p>After you had helped Fedor to find friends in the \u00abCall of Soldiers 3\u00bb game, he stopped studying completely. Today, the English teacher told him to prepare an essay. Fedor didn't want to prepare the essay, so he asked Alex for help. Alex came to help and wrote the essay for Fedor. But Fedor didn't like the essay at all. Now Fedor is going to change the essay using the synonym dictionary of the English language.</p><p>Fedor does not want to change the meaning of the essay. So the only change he would do: change a word from essay to one of its synonyms, basing on a replacement rule from the dictionary. Fedor may perform this operation any number of times.</p><p>As a result, Fedor wants to get an essay which contains as little letters \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>\u00bb (the case doesn't matter) as possible. If there are multiple essays with minimum number of \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>\u00bbs he wants to get the one with minimum length (length of essay is the sum of the lengths of all the words in it). Help Fedor get the required essay.</p><p>Please note that in this problem <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the case of letters doesn't matter</span>. For example, if the synonym dictionary says that word <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">cat</span> can be replaced with word <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">DOG</span>, then it is allowed to replace the word <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Cat</span> with the word <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">doG</span>.</p>",

The second line contains words of the essay. The words are separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that the total length of the words won't exceed <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">5</sup></span> characters.</p><p>The next line contains a single integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(0\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>\u2009\u2264\u200910<sup class=\"upper-index\">5</sup>)</span> \u2014 the number of pairs of words in synonym dictionary.

They mean that word <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> can be replaced with word <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (but not vise versa).
