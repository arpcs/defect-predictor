        "statement": "<p>You have a large rectangular board which is divided into $$$n \\times m$$$ cells (the board has $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns). Each cell is either white or black.</p><p>You paint each white cell either red or blue. Obviously, the number of different ways to paint them is $$$2^w$$$, where $$$w$$$ is the number of white cells.</p><p>After painting the white cells of the board, you want to place the maximum number of dominoes on it, according to the following rules:</p><ul> <li> each domino covers two adjacent cells; </li><li> each cell is covered by at most one domino; </li><li> if a domino is placed horizontally (it covers two adjacent cells in one of the rows), it should cover only red cells; </li><li> if a domino is placed vertically (it covers two adjacent cells in one of the columns), it should cover only blue cells. </li></ul><p>Let the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">value</span> of the board be the maximum number of dominoes you can place. Calculate the sum of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">values</span> of the board over all $$$2^w$$$ possible ways to paint it. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",

The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th string is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">*</span> if the $$$j$$$-th cell in the $$$i$$$-th row is black; otherwise, that character is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">o</span>.</p>",
