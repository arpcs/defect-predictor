Ina of the Mountain, orders Hoshimachi Suisei to throw boulders at them. Ina asks you, Kiryu Coco, to help choose where the boulders are thrown.</span></p><p>There are $$$n$$$ octopuses on a single-file trail on Ina's mountain, numbered $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th octopus has a certain initial health value $$$a_i$$$, where $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq k$$$.</p><p>Each boulder crushes consecutive octopuses with indexes $$$l, l+1, \\ldots, r$$$, where $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$. You can choose the numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ arbitrarily for each boulder.</p><p>For each boulder, the health value of each octopus the boulder crushes is reduced by $$$1$$$. However, as octopuses are immortal, once they reach a health value of $$$0$$$, they will immediately regenerate to a health value of $$$k$$$. </p><p>Given the octopuses' initial health values, find the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> number of boulders that need to be thrown to make the health of all octopuses equal to $$$k$$$.</p>",

The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2013 the number of octopuses, and the upper bound of a octopus's health value.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le k$$$)\u00a0\u2013 the initial health values of the octopuses.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
