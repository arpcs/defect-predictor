Every person is characterized by his/her dancing skill <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. At the beginning of the lesson they line up from left to right. While there is at least one couple of a boy and a girl in the line, the following process is repeated: the boy and girl who stand next to each other, having the minimal difference in dancing skills start to dance. If there are several such couples, the one first from the left starts to dance. After a couple leaves to dance, the line closes again, i.e. as a result the line is always continuous. The difference in dancing skills is understood as the absolute value of difference of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> variable. Your task is to find out what pairs and in what order will start dancing.</p>",

The people are numbered with integers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> from left to right. When a couple leaves to dance you shouldn't renumber the people. The numbers in one couple should be sorted in the increasing order. Print the couples in the order in which they leave to dance.</p>",
