        "statement": "<p>There is an $$$n\\times m$$$ board divided into cells. There are also some dominoes on this board. Each domino covers two adjacent cells (that is, two cells that share a side), and no two dominoes overlap.</p><p>Piet thinks that this board is too boring and it needs to be painted. He will paint the cells of the dominoes black and white. He calls the painting <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beautiful</span> if all of the following conditions hold:</p><ul> <li> for each domino, one of its cells is painted white and the other is painted black; </li><li> for each row, the number of black cells in this row equals the number of white cells in this row; </li><li> for each column, the number of black cells in this column equals the number of white cells in this column. </li></ul><p>Note that the cells that are not covered by dominoes are not painted at all, they are counted as neither black nor white.</p><p>Help Piet produce a beautiful painting or tell that it is impossible.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2\\le n, m\\le 500$$$).</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines describe the tiling of the board, row by row from top to bottom. Each of these lines contains $$$m$$$ characters, describing the cells in the corresponding row from left to right. Each character is one of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">U</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>, or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.</span>, meaning that the cell is covered with a top, bottom, left, right half of a domino or nothing, respectively.

        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, output a single integer $$$-1$$$ if a beautiful painting does not exist. Otherwise, print $$$n$$$ lines, each containing $$$m$$$ characters, describing the colors in the corresponding row of a beautiful painting. Every character corresponding to a cell not covered by a domino must be <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.</span> (a dot), and all other characters must be <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span> if the corresponding cell is black or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">W</span> if it is white.</p><p>If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</p>",
