        "statement": "<p>The first semester ended. You know, after the end of the first semester the holidays begin. On holidays Noora decided to return to Vi\u010dkopolis. As a modest souvenir for Leha, she brought a sausage of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> from Pavlopolis. Everyone knows that any sausage can be represented as a string of lowercase English letters, the length of which is equal to the length of the sausage.</p><p>Leha was very pleased with the gift and immediately ate the sausage. But then he realized that it was a quite tactless act, because the sausage was a souvenir! So the hacker immediately went to the butcher shop. Unfortunately, there was only another sausage of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> in the shop. However Leha was not upset and bought this sausage. After coming home, he decided to cut the purchased sausage into several pieces and number the pieces starting from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> from left to right. Then he wants to select several pieces and glue them together so that the obtained sausage is equal to the sausage that Noora gave. But the hacker can glue two pieces together only when the number of the left piece is less than the number of the right piece. Besides he knows that if he glues more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> pieces, Noora will notice that he has falsified souvenir sausage and will be very upset. Of course Leha doesn\u2019t want to upset the girl. The hacker asks you to find out whether he is able to cut the sausage he bought, and then glue some of the pieces so that Noora doesn't notice anything.</p><p>Formally, you are given two strings <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span>. The length of the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, the length of the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>. It is required to select several pairwise non-intersecting substrings from <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>, so that their concatenation in the same order as these substrings appear in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>, is equal to the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span>. Denote by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i>(<i>s</i>,\u2009<i>t</i>)</span> the minimal number of substrings to be chosen so that their concatenation is equal to the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span>. If it is impossible to choose such substrings, then <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i>(<i>s</i>,\u2009<i>t</i>)\u2009=\u2009\u221e</span>. Leha really wants to know whether it\u2019s true that <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i>(<i>s</i>,\u2009<i>t</i>)\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>x</i></span>.</p>",
