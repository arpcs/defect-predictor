        "statement": "<p>Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.</p><p>A level is a rectangular grid of $$$2$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell $$$(1, 1)$$$\u00a0\u2014 at the intersection of the $$$1$$$-st row and the $$$1$$$-st column.</p><p>Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to cell $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ in one step if $$$|x_1 - x_2| \\le 1$$$ and $$$|y_1 - y_2| \\le 1$$$. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.</p><p>There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.</p><p>To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell $$$(2, n)$$$\u00a0\u2014 at the intersection of row $$$2$$$ and column $$$n$$$.</p><p>Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.</p>",

Each test case consists of three lines.</p><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of columns.</p><p>The next two lines describe the level. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines describes the $$$i$$$-th line of the level\u00a0\u2014 the line consists of the characters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>' and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>'. The character '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>' corresponds to a trap cell.</p><p>Additional constraint on the input: cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(2, n)$$$ are safe.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, output <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span> if it is possible to complete the level, and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span> otherwise.</p>",
