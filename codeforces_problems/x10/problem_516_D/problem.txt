        "statement": "<p>Drazil and Varda are the earthworm couple. They want to find a good place to bring up their children. They found a good ground containing nature hole. The hole contains many rooms, some pairs of rooms are connected by small tunnels such that earthworm can move between them.</p><p>Let's consider rooms and small tunnels as the vertices and edges in a graph. This graph is a <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">tree</span>. In the other words, any pair of vertices has an unique path between them.</p><p>Each room that is <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">leaf</span> in the graph is connected with a ground by a vertical tunnel. Here, <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">leaf</span> is a vertex that has only one outgoing edge in the graph.</p><p>Each room is large enough only to fit one earthworm living in it. Earthworm can't live in a tunnel.</p><p>Drazil and Varda have a plan to educate their children. They want all their children to do morning exercises immediately after getting up!</p><p>When the morning is coming, all earthworm children get up in the same time, then each of them chooses the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">farthest</span> path to the ground for gathering with others (these children are lazy, so they all want to do exercises as late as possible).</p><p>Drazil and Varda want the difference between the time first earthworm child arrives outside and the time the last earthworm child arrives outside to be not larger than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span> (otherwise children will spread around the ground and it will be hard to keep them exercising together).</p><p>Also, The rooms that are occupied by their children should form a <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">connected</span> set. In the other words, for any two rooms that are occupied with earthworm children, all rooms that lie on the path between them should be occupied with earthworm children too.</p><p>How many children Drazil and Varda may have at most in order to satisfy all conditions above? Drazil and Varda want to know the answer for many different choices of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span>.</p><p>(Drazil and Varda don't live in the hole with their children)</p>",
