How would the problem change if it is not here?\nWhat is unusual?\nWhat the problem asks me to do?\nCan I reformulate it as some standard problem? as a play on some standard problem? as a special case of some hard (NP-complete maybe) problem?\nWhile solving the problem:\n\nHow would I solve an easier version of this problem? Decrease limitations. Change the underlying object to something simpler: [graph] \u2192 [connected graph] \u2192 [cactus] \u2192 [unicycle] \u2192 [tree] \u2192 [bamboo/array] or [star]; [matrix/grid] \u2192 [array]. Is there some observation that would work for the general version too?\nHow to answer one query?\nHow would I solve a small case on paper? How would I solve it without time or memory limitations?\nBefore implementing the problem:\n\nWhat\u2019s the complexity?\nDo I understand the problem correctly?\nWhat functions do I need?\nWhich places are tricky? What do I need to remember to implement them correctly?\nWhich place is the heaviest by implementation? Can I do it simpler?\nWhich place is the slowest? Where do I need to be careful about constant factors and where I can choose slower but simpler implementation?\nIf not AC:\n\nDid you remember to do everything to handle the tricky places you thought about before?\nIs the solution correct?\nDo I understand the problem correctly?\nIf you have a test on which the solution gives wrong answer:\n\nIs the solution doing what it was supposed to do?\nIs the problem in the code or in the idea?\nIf stress-test cannot find the counter-test:\n\nDo I understand the problem correctly?\nIs my stupid solution definitely stupid? Does it use any assumptions/observations from the main solution?\nAm I generating all possible test variants? Does the problem have multitest, and if so, am I generating multitest?\nAfter getting accepted:\n\nWhat could I have done better?\nWhat areas took me more time than I would like?\nAre there any tricks to simplify the implementation?\n*/\n"
