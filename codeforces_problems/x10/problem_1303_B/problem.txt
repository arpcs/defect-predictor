        "statement": "<p>Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length $$$n$$$. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing.</p><p>Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are $$$g$$$ days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next $$$b$$$ days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again $$$g$$$ good days, $$$b$$$ bad days and so on.</p><p>You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days $$$1, 2, \\dots, g$$$ are good.</p><p>You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least half of the highway</span> will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the $$$n = 5$$$ then at least $$$3$$$ units of the highway should have high quality; if $$$n = 4$$$ then at least $$$2$$$ units should have high quality.</p><p>What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the whole highway</span>?</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>Next $$$T$$$ lines contain test cases \u2014 one per line. Each line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$g$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, g, b \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the length of the highway and the number of good and bad days respectively.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>Print $$$T$$$ integers \u2014 one per test case. For each test case, print the minimum number of days required to repair <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the whole highway if at least half of it should have high quality</span>.</p>",

        "note": "<p>In the first test case, you can just lay new asphalt each day, since days $$$1, 3, 5$$$ are good.</p><p>In the second test case, you can also lay new asphalt each day, since days $$$1$$$-$$$8$$$ are good.</p>"
