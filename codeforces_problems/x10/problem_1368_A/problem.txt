        "statement": "<p>Leo has developed a new programming language C+=. In C+=, integer variables can only be changed with a \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+=</span>\" operation that adds the right-hand side value to the left-hand side variable. For example, performing \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a += b</span>\" when <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a = </span>$$$2$$$, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b = </span>$$$3$$$ changes the value of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span> to $$$5$$$ (the value of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span> does not change).</p><p>In a prototype program Leo has two integer variables <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>, initialized with some positive values. He can perform any number of operations \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a += b</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b += a</span>\". Leo wants to test handling large integers, so he wants to make the value of either <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span> <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly greater</span> than a given value $$$n$$$. What is the smallest number of operations he has to perform?</p>",
