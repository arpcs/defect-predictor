The boy found out that all the angles of the hexagon are equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/54a57cdcf7e3755ea687c12508bd83854e033ec3.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Then he measured the length of its sides, and found that each of them is equal to an integer number of centimeters. There the properties of the hexagon ended and Gerald decided to draw on it.</p><p>He painted a few lines, parallel to the sides of the hexagon. The lines split the hexagon into regular triangles with sides of 1 centimeter. Now Gerald wonders how many triangles he has got. But there were so many of them that Gerald lost the track of his counting. Help the boy count the triangles.</p>",
