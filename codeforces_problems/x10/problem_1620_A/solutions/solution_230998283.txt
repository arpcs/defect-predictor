In last 7 October in the occupied Palestine,\n\nthe US president in an official interview announced that \"Hamas\" is slaying the children heads,\n\nbut later the white house declared that this did not happen,\n\nand the president was driven to this conclusion by the false announcement made by the Zionist press.\n\nWhich shows how the media continues to raise false accusations without proof to control the public sentiment.\n\nIf you watched the civilians who were captured by the brave defenders on Palestine you will know that children,women,\n\nold people who were not included in any military acts are treated well for a captured enemy,\n\nthey even set free women because they were with their children,\n\nbut no one in the world is going to say and you know why.\n\nThe media have been raising allegation against the Palestinian for defending their land\n\nfor decades while ignoring the crimes committed by the Israeli while trying to widen the occupied territory.\n\nIsrael is trying to commit genocide by falsifying facts and manipulating public opinion.\n\nIn the end, I wanted to clarify that the Palestinian people, including children, women,\n\nand the elderly, are being killed by Israel, which is trying to justify its crimes by falsifying facts and portraying\n\nPalestinians as terrorists when they try to defend their land.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reel/352997087294210\n\n*/\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n#include <iostream>\n#define ll long long\n#define ull unsigned long long\n#define sz(v) (int)v.size()\n#define all(v) v.begin(),v.end()\n#define rall(v) v.rbegin(),v.rend()\n#define dl long double\n#define pii pair<int,int>\n#define pll pair<ll,ll>\n#define oo (ll)1e18\n#define yes cout<<\"YES\\n\"\n#define no cout<<\"NO\\n\"\n#define bigint __int128\n#define IO ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(nullptr), cout.tie(nullptr)\nusing namespace std;\nconst ll N=500+5,mod=1e9+7,mod2=998244353;\nll n,m,k,q,t,ans;\nstring s;\nvoid HAGAG(){\n    cin>>s;\n    n= sz(s);\n    vector<ll>a(n);\n    a[0]=0;\n    int x1=0,x2=0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; ++i) {\n        if (s[i]=='E')x1++;\n        else x2++;\n    }\n    if ((x1==n-1 && s[n-1]=='N')){\n        no;\n        return;\n    }\n    yes;\n}\nint main() {\n    IO;\n    int test=1;\n    cin>>test;\n    while (test--){\n        HAGAG();\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n/**\n           5*4+3*6=\n\n\n */"
