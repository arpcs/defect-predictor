Define function $$$F$$$ as $$$F(B,K)$$$ being sum of products of all $$$K$$$-tuples of elements in array $$$B$$$. For example, if the array $$$B$$$ is $$$[2,3,4,5]$$$, and with $$$K=3$$$, sum of products of all 3-tuples is $$$$$$F(B, 3) = 2*3*4+2*3*5+3*4*5+2*4*5$$$$$$</p><p>He was then given a number Q, number of queries of two types: </p><ul> <li> Type 1: Given $$$q$$$, $$$i$$$, and $$$d$$$ calculate $$$F(B(q, A), K)$$$ where we make change to initial array as $$$A[i] = d$$$. </li><li> Type 2: Given $$$q$$$, $$$L$$$, $$$R$$$, and $$$d$$$ calculate $$$F(B(q, A), K)$$$ where we make change to initial array as $$$A[i] = A[i] + d$$$ for all $$$i$$$ in range $$$[L, R]$$$ inclusive. </li></ul><p>All changes are temporarily made to initial array, and don't propagate to following queries.
