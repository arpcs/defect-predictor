If $$$j$$$-th character of $$$i$$$-th string is equal to '1', then the graph has an edge $$$i \\to j$$$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that there are no edges $$$i \\to i$$$ and the graph has <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one</span> edge among $$$i \\to j$$$ and $$$j \\to i$$$ for different $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$.</p>",
