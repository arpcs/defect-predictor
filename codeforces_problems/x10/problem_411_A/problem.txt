Usually the registration form automatically checks the password's crypt resistance. If the user's password isn't complex enough, a message is displayed. Today your task is to implement such an automatic check.</p><p>Web-developers of the company Q assume that a password is complex enough, if it meets all of the following conditions:</p><ul> <li> the password length is at least 5 characters; </li><li> the password contains at least one large English letter; </li><li> the password contains at least one small English letter; </li><li> the password contains at least one digit. </li></ul><p>You are given a password.
