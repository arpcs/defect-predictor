        "statement": "<p>Brian the Rabbit adores chess. Not long ago he argued with Stewie the Rabbit that a knight is better than a king. To prove his point he tries to show that the knight is very fast but Stewie doesn't accept statements without evidence. He constructed an infinite chessboard for Brian, where he deleted several squares to add some more interest to the game. Brian only needs to count how many different board squares a knight standing on a square with coordinates of <span class=\"tex-span\">(0,\u20090)</span> can reach in no more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> moves. Naturally, it is forbidden to move to the deleted squares.</p><p>Brian doesn't very much like exact sciences himself and is not acquainted with programming, that's why he will hardly be able to get ahead of Stewie who has already started solving the problem. Help Brian to solve the problem faster than Stewie.</p>",

Then follow <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> lines, each giving the coordinates of a deleted square in the form <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>x</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>,\u2009<i>y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>)</span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">|<i>x</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>|\u2009\u2264\u200910,\u2009|<i>y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>|\u2009\u2264\u200910</span>).
