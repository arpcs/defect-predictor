Today he observed that each second exactly one of these prices decreases by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> rubles (note that each second exactly one price changes, but at different seconds different prices can change). Prices can become negative. Oleg found this process interesting, and he asked Igor the financial analyst, what is the minimum time needed for all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> prices to become equal, or it is impossible at all? Igor is busy right now, so he asked you to help Oleg. Can you answer this question?</p>",

In this case all prices become equal <span class=\"tex-span\">9</span> rubles in <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> seconds.</p><p>There could be other possibilities, but this minimizes the time needed for all prices to become equal.

Thus prices never can become equal.</p><p>In the third example following scenario can take place: firstly, the second price drops, then the third price, and then fourth price. It happens <span class=\"tex-span\">999999999</span> times, and, since in one second only one price can drop, the whole process takes <span class=\"tex-span\">999999999\u2009*\u20093\u2009=\u20092999999997</span> seconds. We can note that this is the minimum possible time.</p>"
