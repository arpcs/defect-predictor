        "statement": "<p>Awruk is taking part in elections in his school. It is the final round. He has only one opponent\u00a0\u2014 Elodreip. The are $$$n$$$ students in the school. Each student has exactly $$$k$$$ votes and is obligated to use all of them. So Awruk knows that if a person gives $$$a_i$$$ votes for Elodreip, than he will get exactly $$$k - a_i$$$ votes from this person. Of course $$$0 \\le k - a_i$$$ holds.</p><p>Awruk knows that if he loses his life is over. He has been speaking a lot with his friends and now he knows $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ \u2014 how many votes for Elodreip each student wants to give. Now he wants to change the number $$$k$$$ to win the elections. Of course he knows that bigger $$$k$$$ means bigger chance that somebody may notice that he has changed something and then he will be disqualified.</p><p>So, Awruk knows $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ \u2014 how many votes each student will give to his opponent. Help him select the smallest winning number $$$k$$$. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of students in the school.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of votes each student gives to Elodreip.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>Output the smallest integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge \\max a_i$$$) which gives Awruk the victory. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.</p>",

        "note": "<p>In the first example, Elodreip gets $$$1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 9$$$ votes. The smallest possible $$$k$$$ is $$$5$$$ (it surely can't be less due to the fourth person), and it leads to $$$4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 16$$$ votes for Awruk, which is enough to win.</p><p>In the second example, Elodreip gets $$$11$$$ votes. If $$$k = 4$$$, Awruk gets $$$9$$$ votes and loses to Elodreip.</p>"
