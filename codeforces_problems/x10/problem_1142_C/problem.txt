        "statement": "<p>Recently Vasya learned that, given two points with different $$$x$$$ coordinates, you can draw through them exactly one parabola with equation of type $$$y = x^2 + bx + c$$$, where $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are reals. Let's call such a parabola an $$$U$$$-shaped one.</p><p>Vasya drew several distinct points with integer coordinates on a plane and then drew an $$$U$$$-shaped parabola through each pair of the points that have different $$$x$$$ coordinates. The picture became somewhat messy, but Vasya still wants to count how many of the parabolas drawn don't have any drawn point inside their internal area. Help Vasya.</p><p>The internal area of an $$$U$$$-shaped parabola is the part of the plane that lies strictly above the parabola when the $$$y$$$ axis is directed upwards.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points.</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines describe the points, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and that the coordinates do not exceed $$$10^6$$$ by absolute value.</p>",
