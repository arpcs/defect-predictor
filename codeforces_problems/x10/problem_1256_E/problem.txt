        "statement": "<p>There are $$$n$$$ students at your university. The programming skill of the $$$i$$$-th student is $$$a_i$$$. As a coach, you want to divide them into teams to prepare them for the upcoming ICPC finals. Just imagine how good this university is if it has $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ students ready for the finals!</p><p>Each team should consist of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least three students</span>. Each student should belong to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one team</span>. The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">diversity</span> of a team is the difference between the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximum</span> programming skill of some student that belongs to this team and the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> programming skill of some student that belongs to this team (in other words, if the team consists of $$$k$$$ students with programming skills $$$a[i_1], a[i_2], \\dots, a[i_k]$$$, then the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">diversity</span> of this team is $$$\\max\\limits_{j=1}^{k} a[i_j] - \\min\\limits_{j=1}^{k} a[i_j]$$$).</p><p>The total <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">diversity</span> is the sum of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">diversities</span> of all teams formed.</p><p>Your task is to minimize the total <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">diversity</span> of the division of students and find the optimal way to divide the students.</p>",

        "outputSpecification": "<p>In the first line print two integers $$$res$$$ and $$$k$$$ \u2014 the minimum total <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">diversity</span> of the division of students and the number of teams in your division, correspondingly.</p><p>In the second line print $$$n$$$ integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le t_i \\le k$$$), where $$$t_i$$$ is the number of team to which the $$$i$$$-th student belong.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
