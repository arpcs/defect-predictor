Yes, you're right \u2014 the road network forms an undirected tree.</p><p>Recently, the Mayor came up with a way that eliminates the problems with the food and the IT-infrastructure at the same time! He decided to put at the city junctions restaurants of two well-known cafe networks for IT professionals: \"iMac D0naldz\" and \"Burger Bing\". Since the network owners are not friends, it is strictly prohibited to place two restaurants of different networks on neighboring junctions. There are other requirements. Here's the full list:</p><ul> <li> each junction must have at most one restaurant; </li><li> each restaurant belongs either to \"iMac D0naldz\", or to \"Burger Bing\"; </li><li> each network should build at least one restaurant; </li><li> there is no pair of junctions that are connected by a road and contains restaurants of different networks. </li></ul><p>The Mayor is going to take a large tax from each restaurant, so he is interested in making the total number of the restaurants as large as possible.</p><p>Help the Mayor to analyze the situation. Find all such pairs of <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>a</i>,\u2009<i>b</i>)</span> that <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> restaurants can belong to \"iMac D0naldz\", <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> restaurants can belong to \"Burger Bing\", and the sum of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i>\u2009+\u2009<i>b</i></span> is as large as possible.</p>",
