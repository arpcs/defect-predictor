Mikhail can replace any pair of consecutive moves <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">RU</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">UR</span> with a diagonal move (described as character <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>). After that, he can go on and do some other replacements, until there is no pair of consecutive moves <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">RU</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">UR</span> left.</p><p>Your problem is to print the minimum possible length of the sequence of moves after the replacements.</p>",
