The $$$i$$$-th sheep has to write exactly $$$k$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">non-negative integers</span> with the sum $$$n_i$$$.</p><p>Strangely, sheep have superstitions about digits and believe that the digits $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$9$$$ are lucky. To them, the fortune of a number depends on the decimal representation of the number; the fortune of a number is equal to the sum of fortunes of its digits, and the fortune of a digit depends on its value and position and can be described by the following table. For example, the number $$$319$$$ has fortune $$$F_{2} + 3F_{0}$$$. </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/0f25e3c59e93e15a4265ffe3e236e9dcfd4db69d.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Each sheep wants to maximize the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">sum of fortune</span> among all its $$$k$$$ written integers.
