        "statement": "<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">During the chemistry lesson Andrew learned that the saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) enter into radical chlorination reaction. Andrew is a very curious boy, so he wondered how many different products of the reaction may be forms for a given alkane. He managed to solve the task for small molecules, but for large ones he faced some difficulties and asks you to help.</span></p><p>Formally, you are given a tree consisting of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> vertices, such that the degree of each vertex doesn't exceed <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span>. You have to count the number of distinct non-isomorphic trees that can be obtained by adding to this tree one new vertex and one new edge, such that the graph is still the tree and the degree of each vertex doesn't exceed <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span>.</p><p>Two trees are isomorphic if there exists a bijection <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i>(<i>v</i>)</span> such that vertices <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>u</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i></span> are connected by an edge if and only if vertices <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i>(<i>v</i>)</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i>(<i>u</i>)</span> are connected by an edge.</p>",

Each edge is given by two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>u</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>u</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>,\u2009<i>v</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i></span>)\u00a0\u2014 indices of vertices connected by an edge.
