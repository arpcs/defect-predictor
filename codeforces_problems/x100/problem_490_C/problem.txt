        "statement": "<p>Polycarpus participates in a competition for hacking into a new secure messenger. He's almost won.</p><p>Having carefully studied the interaction protocol, Polycarpus came to the conclusion that the secret key can be obtained if he properly cuts the public key of the application into two parts. The public key is a long integer which may consist of even a million digits!</p><p>Polycarpus needs to find such a way to cut the public key into two nonempty parts, that the first (left) part is divisible by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> as a separate number, and the second (right) part is divisible by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> as a separate number. Both parts should be <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">positive</span> integers that have no leading zeros. Polycarpus knows values <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>.</p><p>Help Polycarpus and find any suitable method to cut the public key.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains the public key of the messenger \u2014 an integer without leading zeroes, its length is in range from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">6</sup></span> digits. The second line contains a pair of space-separated positive integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>a</i>,\u2009<i>b</i>\u2009\u2264\u200910<sup class=\"upper-index\">8</sup></span>).</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>In the first line print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" (without the quotes), if the method satisfying conditions above exists. In this case, next print two lines \u2014 the left and right parts after the cut. These two parts, being concatenated, must be exactly identical to the public key. The left part must be divisible by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, and the right part must be divisible by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>. The two parts must be positive integers having no leading zeros. If there are several answers, print any of them.</p><p>If there is no answer, print in a single line \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" (without the quotes).</p>",
