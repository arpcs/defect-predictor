        "statement": "<p>Every person likes prime numbers. Alice is a person, thus she also shares the love for them. Bob wanted to give her an affectionate gift but couldn't think of anything inventive. Hence, he will be giving her a graph. How original, Bob! Alice will surely be <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">thrilled</span>!</p><p>When building the graph, he needs four conditions to be satisfied: </p><ul> <li> It must be a simple undirected graph, i.e. without multiple (parallel) edges and self-loops. </li><li> The number of vertices must be exactly $$$n$$$\u00a0\u2014 a number he selected. This number is not necessarily prime. </li><li> The total number of edges must be prime. </li><li> The degree (i.e. the number of edges connected to the vertex) of each vertex must be prime. </li></ul><p>Below is an example for $$$n = 4$$$. The first graph (left one) is invalid as the degree of vertex $$$2$$$ (and $$$4$$$) equals to $$$1$$$, which is not prime. The second graph (middle one) is invalid as the total number of edges is $$$4$$$, which is not a prime number. The third graph (right one) is a valid answer for $$$n = 4$$$. </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/76fd86cc29b386a6a2377194a05677ddab6455fa.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Note that the graph can be disconnected.</p><p>Please help Bob to find any such graph!</p>",

        "outputSpecification": "<p>If there is no graph satisfying the conditions, print a single line containing the integer $$$-1$$$.</p><p>Otherwise, first print a line containing a prime number $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of edges in the graph. Then, print $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which containing two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 meaning that there is an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. The degree of each vertex must be prime. There must be no multiple (parallel) edges or self-loops.</p><p>If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.</p><p>Note that the graph can be disconnected.</p>",
