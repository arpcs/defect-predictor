        "statement": "<p>Kotlinforces is a web platfrom that hosts programming competitions.</p><p>The staff of Kotlinforces is asked to schedule $$$n$$$ programming competitions on the next $$$m$$$ days. Each competition is held in multiple stages; the regulations of the $$$i$$$-th competition state that this competition should consist of exactly $$$k_i$$$ stages, and each stage, starting from the second one, should be scheduled <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly $$$t_i$$$ days</span> after the previous stage. In other words, if the first stage of the $$$i$$$-th competition is scheduled on day $$$x$$$, the second stage should be scheduled on day $$$x+t_i$$$, the third stage \u2014 on day $$$x+2t_i$$$, ..., the $$$k_i$$$-th stage (which is the last one) \u2014 on day $$$x+(k_i-1)t_i$$$.</p><p>All $$$n$$$ competitions should be scheduled in such a way that they start and finish during the next $$$m$$$ days, and on any of these $$$m$$$ days, at most one stage of one competition is held (two stages of different competitions should not be scheduled on the same day).</p><p>Is it possible to schedule all $$$n$$$ competitions to meet these constraints?</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 5000$$$) \u2014 the number of competitions and the number of days, respectively.</p><p>Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each describing a competition which should be scheduled. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$k_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ ($$$2 \\le k_i \\le 5000$$$; $$$1 \\le t_i \\le 2$$$) \u2014 the parameters of the $$$i$$$-th competition.</p>",

The $$$i$$$-th integer should represent the day when the first stage of the $$$i$$$-th competition is scheduled; days are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</p>",
