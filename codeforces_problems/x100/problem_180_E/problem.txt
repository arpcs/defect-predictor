Each cube is painted one of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> colors. You are allowed to delete not more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> cubes (that do not necessarily go one after another). After that, the remaining cubes join together (so that the gaps are closed) and the system counts the score. The number of points you score equals to the length of the maximum sequence of cubes of the same color that follow consecutively. Write a program that determines the maximum possible number of points you can score.</p><p>Remember, you may delete no more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> any cubes. It is allowed not to delete cubes at all.</p>",
