        "statement": "<p>One day Greg and his friends were walking in the forest. Overall there were <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> people walking, including Greg. Soon he found himself in front of a river. The guys immediately decided to get across the river. Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> kilograms.</p><p>Greg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself). It turned out that each person weights either 50 or 100 kilograms. Now Greg wants to know what minimum number of times the boat needs to cross the river to transport the whole group to the other bank. The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>.</p><p>Also Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat.</p><p>Help Greg with this problem.</p><p> </p>",

The next line contains <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> integers \u2014 the people's weights. A person's weight is either <span class=\"tex-span\">50</span> kilos or <span class=\"tex-span\">100</span> kilos.</p><p>You can consider Greg and his friends indexed in some way.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>In the first line print an integer \u2014 the minimum number of rides. If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print an integer <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-1</span>.</p><p>In the second line print the remainder after dividing the number of ways to transport the people in the minimum number of rides by number <span class=\"tex-span\">1000000007</span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097)</span>.
