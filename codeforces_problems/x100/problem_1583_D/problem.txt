Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.</p><p>A query consists of an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$. $$$a$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of $$$a$$$ and $$$p$$$, meaning that he will compute an array $$$s$$$ where $$$s_j = p_j + a_j$$$ for all $$$j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Then, he will find the smallest index $$$k$$$ such that $$$s_k$$$ occurs more than once in $$$s$$$, and answer with $$$k$$$. If there is no such index $$$k$$$, then he will answer with $$$0$$$.</p><p>You can perform at most $$$2n$$$ queries. Figure out the meaning of life $$$p$$$.</p>",

        "note": "<p>In the sample, the hidden permutation $$$p$$$ is $$$[3, 2, 1, 5, 4]$$$. Three queries were made.</p><p>The first query is $$$a = [4, 4, 2, 3, 2]$$$. This yields $$$s = [3 + 4, 2 + 4, 1 + 2, 5 + 3, 4 + 2] = [7, 6, 3, 8, 6]$$$. $$$6$$$ is the only number that appears more than once, and it appears first at index $$$2$$$, making the answer to the query $$$2$$$.</p><p>The second query is $$$a = [3, 5, 1, 5, 5]$$$. This yields $$$s = [3 + 3, 2 + 5, 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 4 + 5] = [6, 7, 2, 10, 9]$$$. There are no numbers that appear more than once here, so the answer to the query is $$$0$$$.</p><p>The third query is $$$a = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1]$$$. This yields $$$s = [3 + 5, 2 + 2, 1 + 4, 5 + 3, 4 + 1] = [8, 4, 5, 8, 5]$$$. $$$5$$$ and $$$8$$$ both occur more than once here. $$$5$$$ first appears at index $$$3$$$, while $$$8$$$ first appears at index $$$1$$$, and $$$1 &lt; 3$$$, making the answer to the query $$$1$$$.</p><p>Note that the sample is only meant to provide an example of how the interaction works; it is not guaranteed that the above queries represent a correct strategy with which to determine the answer.</p>"
