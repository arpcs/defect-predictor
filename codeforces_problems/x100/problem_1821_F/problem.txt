        "statement": "<p>There is a beautiful alley with trees in front of a shopping mall. Unfortunately, it has to go to make space for the parking lot.</p><p>The trees on the alley all grow in a single line. There are $$$n$$$ spots for trees, index $$$0$$$ is the shopping mall, index $$$n+1$$$ is the road and indices from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ are the spots for trees. Some of them are taken\u00a0\u2014 there grow trees of the same height $$$k$$$. No more than one tree grows in each spot.</p><p>When you chop down a tree in the spot $$$x$$$, you can make it fall either left or right. If it falls to the left, it takes up spots from $$$x-k$$$ to $$$x$$$, inclusive. If it falls to the right, it takes up spots from $$$x$$$ to $$$x+k$$$, inclusive.</p><p>Let $$$m$$$ trees on the alley grow in some spots $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m$$$. Let an alley be called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">unfortunate</span> if all $$$m$$$ trees can be chopped down in such a way that: </p><ul> <li> no tree falls on the shopping mall or the road; </li><li> each spot is taken up by no more than one fallen tree. </li></ul><p>Calculate the number of different <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">unfortunate</span> alleys with $$$m$$$ trees of height $$$k$$$. Two alleys are considered different if there is a spot $$$y$$$ such that a tree grows in $$$y$$$ on the first alley and doesn't grow in $$$y$$$ on the second alley.</p><p>Output the number modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",
