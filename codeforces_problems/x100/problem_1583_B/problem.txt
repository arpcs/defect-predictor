        "statement": "<p>Lord Omkar would like to have a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) and has asked his disciples to construct the tree. However, Lord Omkar has created $$$m$$$ ($$$\\mathbf{1 \\le m &lt; n}$$$) restrictions to ensure that the tree will be as heavenly as possible. </p><p>A tree with $$$n$$$ nodes is an connected undirected graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$n-1$$$ edges. Note that for any two nodes, there is exactly one simple path between them, where a simple path is a path between two nodes that does not contain any node more than once.</p><p>Here is an example of a tree: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/0c2c664b43f98f7f388ef52d12fba06d30758778.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>A restriction consists of $$$3$$$ pairwise distinct integers, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le a,b,c \\le n$$$). It signifies that node $$$b$$$ cannot lie on the simple path between node $$$a$$$ and node $$$c$$$. </p><p>Can you help Lord Omkar and become his most trusted disciple? You will need to find heavenly trees for multiple sets of restrictions. It can be shown that a heavenly tree will always exist for any set of restrictions under the given constraints.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$\\mathbf{1 \\leq m &lt; n}$$$), representing the size of the tree and the number of restrictions.</p><p>The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i, c_i \\le n$$$, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">$$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ are distinct</span>), signifying that node $$$b_i$$$ cannot lie on the simple path between nodes $$$a_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases will not exceed $$$10^5$$$.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, output $$$n-1$$$ lines representing the $$$n-1$$$ edges in the tree. On each line, output two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$) signifying that there is an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Given edges have to form a tree that satisfies Omkar's restrictions.</p>",

The simple path between $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ is $$$3, 5$$$, which doesn't contain $$$4$$$. The simple path between $$$5$$$ and $$$7$$$ is $$$5, 3, 1, 2, 7$$$, which doesn't contain $$$6$$$. The simple path between $$$6$$$ and $$$4$$$ is $$$6, 7, 2, 1, 3, 4$$$, which doesn't contain $$$5$$$. Thus, this tree meets all of the restrictions.<p>The output of the second sample case corresponds to the following tree: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/91bb7614d530ff4a97985fdbc5086f2e60568451.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center>"
