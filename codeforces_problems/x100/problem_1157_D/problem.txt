        "statement": "<p>Polycarp has to solve exactly $$$n$$$ problems to improve his programming skill before an important programming competition. But this competition will be held very soon, most precisely, it will start in $$$k$$$ days. It means that Polycarp has exactly $$$k$$$ days for training!</p><p>Polycarp doesn't want to procrastinate, so he wants to solve at least one problem during each of $$$k$$$ days. He also doesn't want to overwork, so if he solves $$$x$$$ problems during some day, he should solve no more than $$$2x$$$ problems during the next day. And, at last, he wants to improve his skill, so if he solves $$$x$$$ problems during some day, he should solve at least $$$x+1$$$ problem during the next day.</p><p>More formally: let $$$[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k]$$$ be the array of numbers of problems solved by Polycarp. The $$$i$$$-th element of this array is the number of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$i$$$-th day of his training. Then the following conditions must be satisfied: </p><ul> <li> sum of all $$$a_i$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ should be $$$n$$$; </li><li> $$$a_i$$$ should be <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">greater than zero</span> for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$; </li><li> the condition $$$a_i &lt; a_{i + 1} \\le 2 a_i$$$ should be satisfied for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$. </li></ul><p>Your problem is to find <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span> array $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ satisfying the conditions above or say that it is impossible to do it.</p>",

        "outputSpecification": "<p>If it is impossible to find any array $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ satisfying Polycarp's rules of training, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" in the first line.</p><p>Otherwise print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" in the first line, then print $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$ in the second line, where $$$a_i$$$ should be the number of problems Polycarp should solve during the $$$i$$$-th day.
