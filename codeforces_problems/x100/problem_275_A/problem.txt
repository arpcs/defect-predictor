        "statement": "<p>Lenny is playing a game on a <span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u00d7\u20093</span> grid of lights. In the beginning of the game all lights are switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and all side-adjacent lights. The goal of the game is to switch all the lights off. We consider the toggling as follows: if the light was switched on then it will be switched off, if it was switched off then it will be switched on.</p><p>Lenny has spent some time playing with the grid and by now he has pressed each light a certain number of times. Given the number of times each light is pressed, you have to print the current state of each light.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The input consists of three rows. Each row contains three integers each between 0 to 100 inclusive. The <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>j</i></span>-th number in the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th row is the number of times the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>j</i></span>-th light of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th row of the grid is pressed.</p>",
        "outputSpecification": "<p>Print three lines, each containing three characters. The <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>j</i></span>-th character of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th line is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\" if and only if the corresponding light is switched on, otherwise it's \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>\".</p>",
