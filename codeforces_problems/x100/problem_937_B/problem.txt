        "statement": "<p>The weather is fine today and hence it's high time to climb the nearby pine and enjoy the landscape.</p><p>The pine's trunk includes several branches, located one above another and numbered from <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span>. Some of them (more precise, from <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span>) are occupied by tiny vile grasshoppers which you're at war with. These grasshoppers are known for their awesome jumping skills: the grasshopper at branch <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> can jump to branches <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f4f01b9a6bc3a3deff9c741d951c60f77fcfd59f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.</p><p>Keeping this in mind, you wisely decided to choose such a branch that none of the grasshoppers could interrupt you. At the same time you wanna settle as high as possible since the view from up there is simply breathtaking.</p><p>In other words, your goal is to find the highest branch that cannot be reached by any of the grasshoppers or report that it's impossible.</p>",
        "inputSpecification": "<p>The only line contains two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(2\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>p</i>\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>y</i>\u2009\u2264\u200910<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>)</span>.</p>",

        "note": "<p>In the first sample case grasshopper from branch <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> reaches branches <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">6</span> while branch <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> is initially settled by another grasshopper. Therefore the answer is <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span>.</p><p>It immediately follows that there are no valid branches in second sample case.</p>"
