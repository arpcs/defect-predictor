Three cards are called a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">set</span> if all $$$k$$$ features are good for them.</p><p>For example, the cards $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$, $$$(0, 2, 1)$$$, and $$$(0, 1, 2)$$$ form a set, but the cards $$$(0, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 1, 2)$$$, and $$$(1, 2, 0)$$$ do not, as, for example, the last feature is not good.</p><p>A group of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">five</span> cards is called a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">meta-set</span>, if there is strictly more than one set among them.
