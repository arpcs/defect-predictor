You want to find $$$x$$$.</p><p>At first, you have a set of integers $$$\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$. You can perform the following operations no more than $$$10000$$$ times:</p><ul> <li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span> $$$a$$$: find how many numbers are multiples of $$$a$$$ in the current set. </li><li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span> $$$a$$$: find how many numbers are multiples of $$$a$$$ in this set, and then delete all multiples of $$$a$$$, but $$$x$$$ will never be deleted (even if it is a multiple of $$$a$$$). In this operation, $$$a$$$ must be greater than $$$1$$$. </li><li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span> $$$a$$$: it means that you know that $$$x=a$$$. This operation can be only performed once. </li></ul><p>Remember that in the operation of type <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span> $$$a&gt;1$$$ must hold.</p><p>Write a program, that will find the value of $$$x$$$.</p>",

        "note": "<p>Note that to make the sample more clear, we added extra empty lines. You shouldn't print any extra empty lines during the interaction process.</p><p>In the first test $$$n=10$$$ and $$$x=4$$$.</p><p>Initially the set is: $$$\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$$$.</p><p>In the first operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$4$$$ and delete them. The answer is $$$2$$$ because there are two numbers divisible by $$$4$$$: $$$\\{4,8\\}$$$. $$$8$$$ will be deleted but $$$4$$$ won't, because the number $$$x$$$ will never be deleted. Now the set is $$$\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10\\}$$$.</p><p>In the second operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$2$$$. The answer is $$$4$$$ because there are four numbers divisible by $$$2$$$: $$$\\{2,4,6,10\\}$$$.</p><p>In the third operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$8$$$. The answer is $$$0$$$ because there isn't any number divisible by $$$8$$$ in the current set.</p><p>In the fourth operation, you know that $$$x=4$$$, which is the right answer.</p>"
