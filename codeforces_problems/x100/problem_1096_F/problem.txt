        "statement": "<p>A permutation of size $$$n$$$ is an array of size $$$n$$$ such that each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once in this array. An inversion in a permutation $$$p$$$ is a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i &gt; j$$$ and $$$a_i &lt; a_j$$$. For example, a permutation $$$[4, 1, 3, 2]$$$ contains $$$4$$$ inversions: $$$(2, 1)$$$, $$$(3, 1)$$$, $$$(4, 1)$$$, $$$(4, 3)$$$.</p><p>You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$. However, the numbers on some positions are replaced by $$$-1$$$. Let the valid permutation be such a replacement of $$$-1$$$ in this sequence back to numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the resulting sequence is a permutation of size $$$n$$$.</p><p>The given sequence was turned into a valid permutation randomly with the equal probability of getting each valid permutation.</p><p>Calculate the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.</p><p>It can be shown that it is in the form of $$$\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are non-negative integers and $$$Q \\ne 0$$$.
