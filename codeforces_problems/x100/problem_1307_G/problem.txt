Each road takes some time $$$w_i$$$ to cross. She is currently at field $$$1$$$ and will return to her home at field $$$n$$$ at the end of the day.</p><p>Farmer John has plans to increase the time it takes to cross certain roads. He can increase the time it takes to cross each road by a nonnegative amount, but the total increase cannot exceed $$$x_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th plan. </p><p>Determine the maximum he can make the shortest path from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ for each of the $$$q$$$ independent plans.</p>",

It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain self-loops or parallel edges. It is possible to have a road from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ and a road from $$$v$$$ to $$$u$$$.</p><p>The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$), the number of plans.</p><p>Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$x_i$$$, the query ($$$0 \\le x_i \\le 10^5$$$).</p>",
