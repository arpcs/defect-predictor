However they know that no element should be present in the sets of both companies.</p><p>In order to avoid this representatives of both companies decided to make an agreement on the sets the companies should present. The sets should be chosen in the way that maximizes the total income of the companies.</p><p>All elements are enumerated with integers. The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">ChemForces</span> company has discovered $$$n$$$ distinct chemical elements with indices $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, and will get an income of $$$x_i$$$ Berland rubles if the $$$i$$$-th element from this list is in the set of this company.</p><p>The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">TopChemist</span> company discovered $$$m$$$ distinct chemical elements with indices $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$, and it will get an income of $$$y_j$$$ Berland rubles for including the $$$j$$$-th element from this list to its set.</p><p>In other words, the first company can present any subset of elements from $$$\\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\}$$$ (possibly empty subset), the second company can present any subset of elements from $$$\\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m\\}$$$ (possibly empty subset).
