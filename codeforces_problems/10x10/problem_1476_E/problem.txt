Each string $$$s_j$$$ consists of $$$k$$$ lowercase Latin letters.</p><p>A string $$$a$$$ matches a pattern $$$b$$$ if for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ either $$$b_i$$$ is a wildcard character or $$$b_i=a_i$$$.</p><p>You are asked to rearrange the patterns in such a way that the first pattern the $$$j$$$-th string matches is $$$p[mt_j]$$$.
